  This is the storybook for the React implementation of the Equinor Design
  System. We have a <a href="https://eds.equinor.com/">storefront</a> with
  extensive documentation, this storybook is just for showcasing the components
  and as a place to put developer documentation until we move that to the
  storefront.
