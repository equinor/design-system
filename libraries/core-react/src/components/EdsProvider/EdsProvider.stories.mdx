# EdsProvider

Use the `<EdsProvider />` to provide users with the option of compressing the user interface to see more information at the same time without having to scroll.
Itâ€˜s important **not** to use `compact` as a direct value to density as that breaks comformity to <Abbr title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines">WCAG</Abbr> 2.1 guidelines and makes it harder to use the application for users with either permanent disabilities, or temporary disabilities such as being outdoors under harsh weather conditions with a tablet.

The following example shows how to use the `<Menu />` to change the density of a collection of components. Click `Show code` to see an example of how you might want to set this up.

<Canvas>
  <Story story={stories.Default} />
</Canvas>

<ArgsTable of={EdsProvider} />
