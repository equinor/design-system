# How we work

In Equinor, [how we deliver is as important as what we
deliver](https://www.equinor.com/en/careers/our-culture.html).

This set the expectations for how we collaborate in our open source projects,
and applies to all community members and participants in any Equinor maintained
project.

## Handling issues within the communities

We expect all to have a low threshold for raising issues, or in general discuss
how we live up to our
[values](https://www.equinor.com/en/about-us.html#our-values). Equally, we also
encourage all community members to appreciate when concerns are raised, and make
its best effort in solving them.

As well as responsibility for what is delivered the project maintainers are also
responsible creating an environment for proper handling of issues raised within
the communities.

## Call out for assistance

For any problem not directly resolvable within the community, we encourage you
to call out for assistance. Getting an outsiders perspective on the topic might
be just what is needed for you to proceed.

Send an e-mail to opensource_at_equinor.com and invite for a discussion. The
email will be handled by a team within the Equinor organization.

Your request will be kept confidential from the team or community in question,
unless you chose to disclose it yourself.

## Ethics helpline

In Equinor, we want you to speak up whenever you see unethical behaviour that
conflicts with our values or threatens our reputation.

To underline this, we continuously encourage and remind our employees and any
external third parties interacting with us to raise concerns or report any
suspected or potential breaches of law or company policies.

For any questions or issues that one suspect falls outside the scope of
behaviour regulated, and handled within the open source code of conduct, or you
wish to place an anonymous, confidential report we encourage to use the [Equinor
Ethics
helpline](https://secure.ethicspoint.eu/domain/media/en/gui/102166/index.html).

This helpline is hosted by a third party helpline provider.
