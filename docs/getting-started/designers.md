# Designers
The Equinor Design System (EDS) will empower you to design consistently and prototype rapidly. It is the official interface library for all of Equinorâ€™s internal digital interfaces

## Figma
Figma has been chosen as the tool for prototyping and design when using the EDS. Visit the Figma pages for details about getting started and working with Figma. 

## Device agnostic
All components have been created for interaction on all devices. This means that all interface components can be used easily by mouse, keyboard or touch input. This should help make the EDS future-proof to new technologies.

## Contribution
EDS is based on the contribution of its community. Get in touch with the EDS core team if you have a feature request or visit the EDS designer sandbox to collaborate with the community.
