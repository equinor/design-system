# About EDS
The Equinor design system (EDS) is Equinor's official design system and is to be used when designing, prototyping and developing internal digital interfaces.

## What is EDS
The EDS provides a collection of guidelines and reusable components that can be assembled in different combinations to design and build digital interfaces. All design and code components are high-quality, production-grade and accessibility-tested. This allows Equinor to manage design at scale by creating a single source of truth for teams to design, prototype and develop.

Using the EDS helps to ensure the Equinor brand and visual identity is applied when building digital interfaces. The EDS core team works together with Equinor's corporate brand team to make sure the EDS is aligned and consistent with the Equinor brand. Specific brand guidelines can be found at the [Equinor Brand Center](https://communicationtoolbox.equinor.com/brandcenter/en/equinor/) (internal Equinor link). 

## Goals

The EDS creates a visual UI language that is based on standard UI patterns for real people.

### Efficient

It's a reliable, working system that allows teams to focus their time on creating great experiences and solving complex logic.

### Collaborative

The EDS is open for all teams working with design and development at Equinor. Everyone is encouraged to contribute.

## Principles
### Flexible

Built to be flexible. Its components are designed to work smoothly with each other.

### Accessible

It's designed and developed to be accessible to everyone---regardless of their ability or situation.

### Meaningful motion

Motion is used to focus attention and is not decorative.

### Cross-platform

Maintains the same UI across platforms---using shared components, tokens and guidelines.
