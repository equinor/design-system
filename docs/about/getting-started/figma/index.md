## Getting access to Figma in Equinor

Instructions for applying for access and first time log in are on .

## Joining an existing team in Figma

Contact your team _admin_ or _owner_ to add you to the team or search in Figma for the team you wish to join and request access.

-   You will be added as a _viewer_ by default. If you plan to edit, ask your team _admin_ or _owner_ to upgrade you.
    
-   _Viewers_ can:
    
    -   View and comment on files and projects in which they have access.
        
    -   View a list of _all_ teams in the Equinor Figma Organisation.
        
    -   Access the EDS components, styles and fonts.
        
-   _Editors_ can do everything a _viewer_ can, plus they can create and edit files.
    

## Creating a team in Figma

Start by reading about  on Figma's help pages. New teams are created under the Equinor organisation area. Make sure to search first to ensure the team doesn't already exist. Projects should not be mixed, so make one team per project. Give the team an appropriate name, knowing that anyone in Figma can see the name. Please delete the default project folder **Design System** since this is not the EDS and can cause confusion. The user creating a team becomes the team _owner_, but this can be re-assigned later to another team member.

### Team owner responsibilities

Team _owners_ are the single point of contact for the Figma team, and the Figma administrators and EDS Core team will reach out to them when necessary. Team _owners_ are expected to read and follow the Figma guidelines found here on the EDS storefront.

### Team member management

-   _Members_ are users that have access to the Equinor Figma organization.
    
-   By default, members added to a team will be added as a _viewer_.
    
-   It is the _team owner's_ choice to upgrade the _viewer_ to _editor, owner_ or _admin_. If you are unable to upgrade a _viewer_ to an _editor_, reach out to .
    
-   Users are currently able to upgrade themselves to an _editor_ by transferring a file into the team from their drafts. However, this can be blocked on a user-by-user basis by the _admins_ of the Equinor Figma organisation.
    
-   As the team _owner_, it is your responsibility to make sure that _only_ those requiring it are _editors_. _Owners_, _admins_ and _editors_ incur a monthly cost to Equinor---however, _viewers_ do not. It is possible to upgrade someone to an _editor_ and downgrade them within the same billing cycle.
    
    -   If an _editor_ is on an extended leave, change their account to _viewer_ and upgrade them when they return.
        
    -   If a team member is no longer part of the team, remove them from the team.

# Figma

Figma is the selected tool for prototyping and design when using the Equinor design system (EDS).

## Setting up

Each file created inside a project must contain a cover page. A cover page sits on the first page of every file, and the page name should be _Cover_. Place the `Default File Cover` on the page and fill in the information. This allows others to know who is responsible for this file and who to ask if they have questions. Change the status badge as the file progresses, remembering to change the background colour of the cover page to match the current badge colour.

## Working clean

Use the pages on the left side of Figma to stay organised. There is not limit to the amount of pages you can create in Figma. Break apart main sections of your app, if necessary. Create a page for custom components for that project if needed. Also, consider making a page for sketches and ideas. Everything on pages that your team members will be using should be clean and organised.

Lay out your frames/artboards to go across the screen horizontally. Make sure they are all aligned to the same top line and have equal spacing between each frame. Variation of the same page should be organised vertically under the related page. This aids in switching between files and teams seamlessly.

Example of a frame/artboard layout

## Grids

-   Change your nudge amount to 8px, learn how .
    
-   Make sure to read the EDS grid guidelines before working with the EDS.
    
-   Always place everything on an artboard/frame.
    

-   In the left sidebar, choose the tab **Assets**.
    

-   You can then scroll through the list to find the component or you can use the search box.
    
-   Click and drag the component out to the frame you need it on.
    
-   Do not change the colours or layouts.
    

From time to time, components will be updated in the EDS library---these can be reviewed, then accepted or denied.

If accepted, all instances of the updated component(s) will be updated. This will not change the content that you have overridden, like custom colours or text. If denied, you will be asked again the next time you load the file. More details can be found .

## Clickbounds are hidden by default

When starting to use Figma, you might wonder why some components, such as buttons, have a larger bounding box than visual presence. This is due to a layer called the clickbound which is 48px in height. This is in accordance with the WCAG guidelines for touch targets.

## Placeholders

When building layouts, you can add a placeholder where you don’t have content ready. Placeholders are also built into many EDS components.

When a nested component is ready, simply replace the placeholder by dragging the component over the placeholder while holding down the shortcut described below.

-   Mac: Ctrl + Apple key
    
-   PC: Ctrl + Alt
