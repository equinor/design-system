# General guidelines for React components

- Test your component in the latest version of evergreen browsers
- Use CSS grids for layout where appropriate
- Write tests in Jest
- Take time to learn from other design systems
  - [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/) (EDS is heavily inspired by Material Design)
  - [Sprout Social](https://sproutsocial.com/seeds/components/) (A lot of similarities with EDS)
  - [Reach UI](https://reacttraining.com/reach-ui/) (Excellent on a11y)
- Keep the component as simple as possible
- Always get in touch with one of the lead developers before you start work on a component
- Components issues labelled "storefront" have the highest priority
