# @equinor/eds-tailwind

Tailwind CSS theme for Equinor Design System (EDS).

This package exposes the EDS theme tokens and Tailwind `@theme` declarations as plain CSS. Import it from your app-level stylesheet so Tailwind v4 can process the directives.

## Usage

1. Ensure Tailwind v4 is configured in your app and that `@import "tailwindcss";` exists in your global stylesheet.
2. Import the theme after Tailwind (order does not strictly matter, but keeping them together is convenient):

```css
@import 'tailwindcss';
@import '@equinor/eds-tailwind';
```

The package also imports `@equinor/eds-tokens/css/variables-static.css` to make the CSS variables available.

## Demo

Open `demo.html` in a browser to explore all background, text, and border color utilities generated by the EDS Tailwind theme. The example links to `theme.css` and uses the Tailwind CDN to build the classes at runtime.
