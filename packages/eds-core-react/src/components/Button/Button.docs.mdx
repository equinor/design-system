## Usage

```tsx
import { Button } from '@equinor/eds-core-react'

<Button>Click me!</Button>
```

### Using the 'as' prop to render as another component

The `as` prop allows you to render the `Button` as another html element or even react component. 

```tsx
<Button as="a" href="/about" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">About</Button>
```
This is especially useful if you want to use the `Button` as as a navigation component for a third party routing library such as react-router.

```tsx
import { Link } from "react-router-dom"
import { Button } from '@equinor/eds-core-react'

<Button as={Link} to="/about">About</Button>
```
A special note about **nextLink**: The `href` type from this component conflicts with the native href type, therefore it is recommended to use the legacy behavior in this case, or alternatively ts-ignore.
```tsx
import NextLink from 'next/link'
import { Button } from '@equinor/eds-core-react'

<NextLink href="/about" passHref legacyBehavior>
  <Button as="a">About</Button>
</NextLink>

/* Or */

 <Button
   as={NextLink}
   /* @ts-ignore */
   href={{ pathname: "/foo/bar", query: { id: assetId } }}
>
   Bar
</Button>
```
## Accessibility
The `aria-disabled` attribute makes it possible to semantically disable the `Button` without hiding it from assistive technologies, such as screen readers. 
In EDS, the `Button` will be visually styled as disabled, but it is up to the developer to actually disable the button.

<Canvas of={ComponentStories.Accessibility} />

## Examples

### Basic
The `Button` come with five variants; `contained`,  `contained_icon`, `outlined`, `ghost` and `ghost_icon`.

<Canvas of={ComponentStories.Basic} />

### Icon button
The `ghost_icon` & `contained_icon`variant is meant for standalone icon buttons using the `<Icon>` component.  
Make sure to define `aria-label` with descriptive text of `Button` interaction.

<Canvas of={ComponentStories.IconButton} />

### Color

<Canvas of={ComponentStories.Color} />

### Hierarchy
Use variants to differentiate the hierarchy.
<ul>
  <li><code>Contained</code> - being high-emphasis.</li>
  <li><code>Outlined</code> - being medium-emphasis.</li>
  <li><code>Ghost</code> - being low-emphasis.</li>
</ul>

<Canvas of={ComponentStories.Hierarchy} />

### Compact
Compact mode is toggled using [EdsProvider](?path=/docs/edsprovider--introduction).

Note that compact mode should come with the possibility to switch to normal mode for accessibility reasons.

<Canvas of={ComponentStories.Compact} />

### Progress button
Use the `Progress` component if you need progress indication on a button.

<Canvas of={ComponentStories.ProgressButton} />

### Disabled buttons and tooltip
Due to inconsistent browser support for mouse events on disabled buttons, `Tooltip` 
should not be used in combination with `disabled` on `Button`. Instead use `aria-disabled` 
and disable the `onClick` in the code. This has the added benefit of making the 
Tooltip accessible for people using keyboard navigation, as the button is still focusable.

<Canvas of={ComponentStories.WithTooltip} />

### Full width
When stretching a button beyond its intrinsic width, the `fullWidth` prop can be used to position icon at the edge.

<Canvas of={ComponentStories.FullWidth} />

### All
All button combinations. 

<Canvas of={ComponentStories.All} />
