## Usage

Tabs allow for navigation between content that is related and has an equal hierarchy.

<ul>
    <li>Each tab's content should be noticeably different from the other.</li>
    <li>Tabs allow for information to be presented in a space-saving layout.</li>
    <li>Tab labels should provide clear and concise direction.</li>
    <li>Note that if the label is longer than the maximum width it will be truncated and should have a tooltip provided.</li>
</ul>

```tsx
import { Dialog } from '@equinor/eds-core-react'

<Tabs>
    <Tabs.List>
      <Tabs.Tab>One</Tabs.Tab>
      <Tabs.Tab>Two</Tabs.Tab>
    </Tabs.List>
    <Tabs.Panels>
      <Tabs.Panel>Panel one</Tabs.Panel>
      <Tabs.Panel>Panel two</Tabs.Panel>
    </Tabs.Panels>
</Tabs>

```

## Examples

### States

<Story id="navigation-tabs--states" />

### Widths

Tab width can be decided by three factors:
<ol>
    <li>The width of the space available being equally divided by the number of tabs. This method is only to be used for four tabs or less.</li>
    <li>The width of the widest tab determining the width of all the tabs to provide visual balance. 
        This should be used with caution ensuring all tabs will be seen in smaller layouts.</li>
    <li>Each tab having its own minimum width to conserve space.</li>
</ol>

### With panels

To navigate using the keyboard use:
<ul>
    <li><code>TAB</code> to move from tab to tab panel.</li>
    <li><code>SHIFT + TAB</code> to go backwards.</li>
    <li><code>LEFT / RIGHT ARROW</code> to move from between tabs (active tab must be focused).</li>
</ul>

Focus outline is only visible when navigating using the keyboard.

### Overflow with next/previous buttons

Tabs uses css `scroll-snap`, so in a case where there is overflow and the user wants to add next/previous buttons for scrolling, 
they can use `element.scrollTo` some amount and then css will take care of alignment.

<Story id="navigation-tabs--overflow" />

### Overflow with default scrollbar

In the case of tabs overflowing, and where next/previous buttons are not desired, the `scrollable` prop adds `overflow-x: auto` to the tabs list. 
Tabs uses css `scroll-snap` which handles alignment and tabs snapping into place. 
Note that scrollbar had been disabled for touch devices since the tabs are swipeable.
