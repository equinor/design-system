## Usage

A banner displays an important, brief message, and provides actions for users to address. 
It requires a user action to be dismissed.

<ul>
    <li>Banners are interruptive, but their level of interruption should match 
        the information they hold and the context in which they appear.</li>
    <li>Only one banner should be shown at a time.</li>
</ul>

```tsx
import { Banner } from '@equinor/eds-core-react'

<Banner>
  <Banner.Message>
    Banner message comes here.
  </Banner.Message>
</Banner>
```

## Examples

### Text and icon

Banners can supplement their message using a supporting icon.

<Canvas of={ComponentStories.TextAndIcon} />

### Text and action

<ul>
  <li>Buttons in banners should directly relate to a banner’s message and clearly represent the banner’s action.</li>
  <li>Buttons must be labelled with text, not icons, for clarity.</li>
  <li>Place buttons under the banner message, or on the same line if there is enough room to fit both.</li>
</ul>

<Canvas of={ComponentStories.TextAndAction} />

### Text and icon and action

<ul>
  <li>The banner message communicates a change or error within an app.</li>
  <li>Banners should be considered as part of your overall in-app messaging strategy.</li>
</ul>

<Canvas of={ComponentStories.TextAndIconAndAction} />

### Complex Banner Content (special cases)

While using string content for Banner.Message is the recommended approach for most use cases, there are situations where more complex content might be necessary. For these special cases, Banner.Content is created to support ReactNode children.

<ul>
  <li>Use string content for Banner.Message whenever possible to maintain consistency and proper styling.</li>
  <li>Only use Banner.Content when you have specific requirements that cannot be met with string content.</li>
  <li>When using Banner.Content, be mindful of accessibility, responsive behavior, and Equinor design guidelines.</li>
</ul>

Some examples where Banner.Content might be appropriate:
- Content requiring specific formatting (bold text, code elements)
- Content with structured information that benefits from hierarchical display
- Content with links

<Canvas of={ComponentStories.ComplexBannerContent} />
