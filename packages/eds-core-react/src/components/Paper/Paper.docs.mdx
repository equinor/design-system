## Usage

Shadows are the only visual cue indicating the amount of separation between surfaces, that makes an element look like it's floating above the surface.

 <ul>
    <li>Shadows provide important visual cues about objects’ depth and directional movement.</li>
    <li>The elevation can be used to establish a hierarchy between other content.</li>
    <li>In practical terms, the elevation controls the size of the shadow applied to the surface.</li>
  </ul>

```tsx
import { Paper } from '@equinor/eds-core-react'

<Paper />
```
