## Usage

`Snackbars` inform users of an activity that an app has performed or will perform. <br />
 <ul>
    <li>Only one snackbar may be displayed at a time.</li>
    <li>Snackbars appear temporarily, and disappear on their own without claiming user input to be dismissed.</li>
    <li>Snackbars are placed in the most suitable area of a UI, mainly at the bottom of the UI and in a front of app content.</li>
    <li>Avoid placing a snackbar in front of frequently used touch targets or navigation.</li>
  </ul>

  ```tsx
import { Snackbar } from '@equinor/eds-core-react'


<Snackbar>Snackbar text</Snackbar>
```

## Examples

### Simple

<ul>
    <li>Snackbars appear without warning, and don not require user interaction.</li>
    <li>When multiple snackbar updates are necessary, they should appear one at a time.</li>
</ul>

<Canvas of={ComponentStories.Simple} />

### With action

A snackbar can contain a single action, a single text button that lets users take action on a process performed by the app.

<Canvas of={ComponentStories.WithAction} />
