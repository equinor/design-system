## Usage

`Linear progress` indicators are great to focus attention to an area.

<ul>
  <li>Progress indicators inform users about the current loading state giving them insight into the process.</li>
  <li>Progress indicators look and animate in ways that reflect the status of a process. They are never simply decorative.</li>
  <li>Progress indicators should be applied to all cases of a process in a consistent format.</li>
  <li>Linear progress indicators are great for places like empty pages, at the bottom of the top bar, and in cards and lists.</li>
</ul>

```tsx
import { LinearProgress } from '@equinor/eds-core-react'

<LinearProgress />
```

## Examples

### Indeterminate

Indeterminate operations display the indicator continually growing and shrinking along the track until the process is complete.

<Canvas of={ComponentStories.Indeterminate} />

### Determinate

Determinate operations display the indicator increasing in width from 0 to 100% of the track, in sync with the process’s progress.

<Canvas of={ComponentStories.Determinate} />

### Acessibility
`Linear progress` have `role="progressbar"` and therefore either `aria-describedby` or `aria-label` should be included.
