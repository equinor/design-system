## Usage

`Circular progress` indicators are great for places like icons and empty pages. They should be used for short waiting times.

<ul>
  <li>Progress indicators inform users about the current loading state giving them insight into the process.</li>
  <li>Progress indicators look and animate in ways that reflect the status of a process. They are never simply decorative.</li>
  <li>Progress indicators should be applied to all cases of a process in a consistent format.</li>
  <li>Circular progress indicators can be applied directly to a surface, such as a button or card.</li>
</ul>

```tsx
import { CircularProgress } from '@equinor/eds-core-react'

<CircularProgress />
```
