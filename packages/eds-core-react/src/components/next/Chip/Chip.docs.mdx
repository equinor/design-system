# Chip

**⚠️ Beta Component** - This component is under active development and may have breaking changes.

## What's different from the current Chip?

> **ℹ️ Design rationale** — The next Chip has intentional differences from the current (`eds-core-react`) Chip:
>
> 1. **Outlined by default.** The current chip uses a subtle gray fill that provides very little contrast — nearly invisible for users with low vision. The conundrum is that increasing the gray background's opacity, has two negative sideeffects: 1. decreases the readability (less contrast between background and text) 2. makes it look disabled. The solution: Outline styling. The new outlined style gives a clear, accessible boundary while keeping chips visually lightweight.
>
> 2. **More color variations.** Consuming projects need a wider palette. The next Chip supports 5 semantic colors (`accent`, `danger`, `warning`, `info`, `success`) and 16 data-visualization colors via the `color` prop.
>
> 3. **All chips are interactive.** The non-interactive variant has been removed. Chips look and are now sized as interactive elements (min 32 px), so mixing interactive and non-interactive variants created confusion — users could not tell them apart. Non-interactive use-cases is covered by the new **Badge** component.

```bash
npm install @equinor/eds-core-react@beta
```

```tsx
import { Chip } from '@equinor/eds-core-react/next'
```

Chips are compact, interactive elements used for filtering, selecting options, or triggering actions.

<Controls />

## Usage

```tsx
import { Chip } from '@equinor/eds-core-react/next'
import { save } from '@equinor/eds-icons'

// Basic chip
<Chip>Label</Chip>

// Selected chip
<Chip selected>Selected</Chip>

// With icon
<Chip icon={save}>Save</Chip>

// Deletable chip
<Chip onDelete={() => console.log('deleted')}>Removable</Chip>

// Colored chip
<Chip color="danger">Error</Chip>
<Chip color="magenta">Custom</Chip>
```

### Chip vs Badge

A Chip is interactive — it can be clicked, selected, deleted, or used as a dropdown trigger. When a status is purely informational and does not need user action, use a [Badge](?path=/docs/eds-2-0-beta-data-display-badge--docs) instead.

<Canvas of={ComponentStories.ChipVsBadge} />

## Examples

### Chip types

Chips come in four types — **Assist**, **Filter**, **Input**, and **Suggestion** — distinguished by their behaviour rather than a `type` prop. Chips can also be used as colored **tags** to visually categorise or label items.

Assist chip example:
<Canvas of={ComponentStories.Assist} />

Filter chip example:
<Canvas of={ComponentStories.Filter} />

### Active filter bar

Chips combined with a filter button to show active filters.

<Canvas of={ComponentStories.ActiveFilterBar} />

Input chip example:
<Canvas of={ComponentStories.Input} />

Suggestion chip example:
<Canvas of={ComponentStories.Suggestion} />

Tag chip example:
<Canvas of={ComponentStories.Tags} />

### Density

Use `data-density="comfortable"` on a parent element for a more compact size.

<Canvas of={ComponentStories.Density} />
