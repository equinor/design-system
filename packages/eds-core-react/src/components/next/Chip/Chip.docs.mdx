# Chip

**⚠️ Beta Component** - This component is under active development and may have breaking changes.

## What's different from the current Chip?

> **ℹ️ Design rationale** — The next Chip has intentional differences from the current (`eds-core-react`) Chip:
>
> 1. **Outlined by default.** The current chip uses a subtle gray fill that provides very little contrast — nearly invisible for users with low vision. The new outlined style gives a clear, accessible boundary while keeping chips visually lightweight.
>
> 2. **More color variations.** Consuming projects need a wider palette. The next Chip supports 5 semantic colors (`accent`, `danger`, `warning`, `info`, `success`) and 16 data-visualization colors via the `color` prop.
>
> 3. **All chips are interactive.** The non-interactive variant has been removed. Chips look and are now sized as interactive elements (min 32 px), so mixing interactive and non-interactive variants created confusion — users could not tell them apart. Non-interactive use-cases will be covered by a dedicated **Label** component (coming soon).

```bash
npm install @equinor/eds-core-react@beta
```

```tsx
import { Chip } from '@equinor/eds-core-react/next'
```

Chips are compact, interactive elements used for filtering, selecting options, or triggering actions.

<Controls />

## Usage

```tsx
import { Chip } from '@equinor/eds-core-react/next'
import { save } from '@equinor/eds-icons'

// Basic chip
<Chip>Label</Chip>

// Selected chip
<Chip selected>Selected</Chip>

// With icon
<Chip icon={save}>Save</Chip>

// Deletable chip
<Chip onDelete={() => console.log('deleted')}>Removable</Chip>

// Colored chip
<Chip color="danger">Error</Chip>
<Chip color="magenta">Custom</Chip>
```

## Examples

### Chip types

Chips come in four types — **Assist**, **Filter**, **Input**, and **Suggestion** — distinguished by their behaviour rather than a `type` prop.

<Canvas of={ComponentStories.Assist} />
<Canvas of={ComponentStories.Filter} />
<Canvas of={ComponentStories.Input} />
<Canvas of={ComponentStories.Suggestion} />

### Density

Use `data-density="comfortable"` on a parent element for a more compact size.

<Canvas of={ComponentStories.Density} />

### Active filter bar

Chips combined with a filter button to show active filters.

<Canvas of={ComponentStories.ActiveFilterBar} />

### Tags

Colored, deletable chips used as status tags.

<Canvas of={ComponentStories.Tags} />
