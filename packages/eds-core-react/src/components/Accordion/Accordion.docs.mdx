## Usage

<ul>
    <li>Accordions are composed of a header area and a content area.</li>
    <li>Accordions deliver large amounts of information in user-controlled sections.</li>
    <li>Accordions can be used to group or hide information which helps to keep order and scannability on a page.</li>
</ul>
<b>Note:</b> `Accordion` should only contain `Accordion.Item` as direct children.

```tsx
import { Accordion } from '@equinor/eds-core-react'

<Accordion>
  <Accordion.Item>
    <Accordion.Header>Simple header</Accordion.Header>
    <Accordion.Panel>Content 1</Accordion.Panel>
  </Accordion.Item>
  <Accordion.Item>
    <Accordion.Header>
      <Accordion.HeaderTitle>
        Header with actions
      </Accordion.HeaderTitle>
      <Accordion.HeaderActions>
        <Button variant="ghost_icon">
          <Icon name="edit" title="Edit" />
        </Button>
      </Accordion.HeaderActions>
    </Accordion.Header>
    <Accordion.Panel>Content 2</Accordion.Panel>
  </Accordion.Item>
</Accordion>
```

## Examples

### Header

<ul>
    <li>The header is accompanied with two subcomponents, <code>Accordion.HeaderTitle</code> and 
    <code>Accordion.HeaderActions</code> which should be used if there is a need
     for additional action buttons in the header. Raw text will get wrapped 
     in an <code>Accordion.HeaderTitle</code> automatically.</li>
      <li>For accessibility, please make sure to set the correct `headerLevel` based on the context the Accordion is used in. An accordion under a `h2` paragraph should be set to `h3`and so on. There is no visual difference between Accordion headerlevels.</li>
    <li>The expand/collapse functionality is tied to the entire header.</li>
</ul>

<Canvas of={ComponentStories.Header} />

### Controlled

Use `onExpandedChange` prop on `Accordion.Item` to make it a controlled component
<Canvas of={ComponentStories.Controlled} />
