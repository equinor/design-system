# Calendar

If you don't need the accessible input fields, but you need a calendar with EDS styling, you can use the `Calendar` component.

This requires you to create and manage your calendar state / props yourself by using the hooks from [react-aria](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria).

<Primary />
<Controls />
