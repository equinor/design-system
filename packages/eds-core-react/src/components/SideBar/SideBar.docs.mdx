# SideBar

Sidebar is a layout component anchored to the left hand side of the screen. 
It has a toggleable collapsed and expanded state. This is an adaptation of the [Amplify Components](https://storybook-amplify-components.app.radix.equinor.com/?path=/docs/navigation-sidebar--primary) `SideBar`

## Usage

`SideBar` is anchored to the left side of the screen. If it is used together with `TopBar`, 
`SideBar` should be below it, and not run over or under the `TopBar`.

<ul>
    <li>The Sidebar does not scroll away, being a consistent guidepost to users.</li>
    <li><code>SideBar.Content</code> and <code>SideBar.Footer</code> are subcomponents for layout. 
    You should normally use these to contain the other content.</li>
    <li><code>SideBar.Toggle</code> is optional and should be placed either at the top or in the footer.</li>
</ul>

```tsx
import { SideBar, SidebarLinkProps } from '@equinor/eds-core-react'
  const menuItemsInitial: SidebarLinkProps[] = [
    {
      name: 'Home',
      icon: home,
      href: '/',
      active: false,
    },
    {
      name: 'Dashboard',
      icon: dashboard,
      href: '/dashboard',
      active: false,
    },
  ]
  const [menuItems, setMenuItems] = useState(menuItemsInitial)
  const updateActive = () => {
    /* Logic to update active state of links */
  }

  <SideBar>
      <SideBar.Content>
        <SideBar.Toggle />
        {menuItems.map((m) => (
            <SideBar.Link key={m.name} {...m} />
          ))}
      </SideBar.Content>
  </SideBar>
```

## Examples

### With TopBar
If used together with `TopBar`, the layout should be handled with css-grid to ensure the sidebar does not extend beyond the screen and creates overflow.
<Canvas of={ComponentStories.WithTopbar} />

### SideBar.Link

`SideBar.Link` requires both `label` and `icon` due to the visual style of the collapsed state. 
Navigation can be done with `href`, or in the case of a third party routing library, one can use the `as` prop 
to override component type and allow their specific props. 
Use the `active` property to indicate current active path when used for navigation.
<Canvas of={ComponentStories.ActivePath} />

### With custom content

Use <code>useSideBar</code> to detect sidebar state in your custom content if it needs to be modified based on expanded/collapsed state. 
Here it is used to make the footer with two states.
```tsx
import { SideBar, useSideBar } from '@equinor/eds-core-react'
```
<Canvas of={ComponentStories.CustomContent} />

### With Button

`SideBar.Button` can be used to perform actions. It must have an icon and a label.
<Canvas of={ComponentStories.WithButton} />

### With Accordion

`SideBar.Accordion` can be used to separate links into groups that are expandable. The expanded state of each
Accordion can be controlled by using the `toggleExpand` and `isExpanded` props. These can be omitted
to make the component un-controlled. Similar to `SideBar.Link`,  `SideBar.AccordionItem` is an overridable component
by using the `as` prop. For example `as={Link}` to make it a `react-router` link.
<Canvas of={ComponentStories.WithAccordion} />

### With routing

This is a complete example of how the SideBar can be used for navigation, including all components available to use.
We are using state to decide which page to display. In the real world you would likely use a router.
<Canvas of={ComponentStories.WithRouting} />

### Controlled Active State

As default, the AccordionHeader is highlighted if it has an active child and is closed (see Routing-example above for default behavior).
This is possible to override by sending the `active`-prop to the Accordion.
<Canvas of={ComponentStories.ControlledActiveState} />
