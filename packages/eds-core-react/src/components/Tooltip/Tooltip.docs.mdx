## Usage

The information provided should be very short and descriptive and explain icon meanings or differences between components.

<ul>
  <li>Tooltips should aim to have a single line of text that does not wrap, and is kept to under 80 characters in length.</li>
  <li>The position of the tooltip is flexible, and they should always point to the component to which they give information about.</li>
</ul>

```tsx
import { Tooltip } from '@equinor/eds-core-react'

<Tooltip>
  <Button variant="ghost_icon">
    <Icon title="explore"></Icon>
  </Button>
</Tooltip>
```

## Accessibility

Keep in mind that if `Tooltip` is added to a non-focusable element, it is inaccessible to people dependent on keyboard navigation and assistive technologies.

## Styling
`Tooltip` have the classname `eds-tooltip` to make it easier to style the component globally, including tooltips built into other eds components such as `Sidebar`. Individual tooltips can otherwise be styled with `style`, `className` or `styled(Tooltip)`


## Examples

### With delay

Tooltip opening is delayed with `300ms`.

<Canvas of={ComponentStories.WithDelay} />

### On table cells

Example of how `Tooltip` can be used on `Table.Cell`.

<Canvas of={ComponentStories.OnTableCells} />

### Long list with tooltips

Long list of elements that have a tooltip. Used for testing if tooltip "lag" when scrolling while tooltips are visible.

<Canvas of={ComponentStories.LongListWithTooltips} />

### Radio and checkboxes

Inputs of type radio, checkbox and switch will have the tooltip applied to the input element. A good way to get the tooltip to also apply to the label is to simply wrap the input in a span.

<Canvas of={ComponentStories.RadioAndCheckboxes} />

### Tooltip on disabled Button
Due to inconsistent browser support for mouse events on disabled buttons, `Tooltip` should not be used in combination with `disabled` on `Button`. 
Instead use `aria-disabled` and disable the `onClick` in the code. This has the added benefit of making the Tooltip accessible for people using 
keyboard navigation, as the button is still focusable.

<Canvas of={ComponentStories.TooltipOnButton} />

### Custom root element
Some apps might not want to use the default root element for the tooltip. This can be changed by passing a custom `portalContainer` to the `Tooltip` component, or by setting the `rootElement` prop on the `EdsProvider`

<Canvas of={ComponentStories.CustomRootElement} />
