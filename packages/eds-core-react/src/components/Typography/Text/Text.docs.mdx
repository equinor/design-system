# Text
This component is currently available in the beta release of eds-core-React: <br />
`npm install @equinor/eds-core-react@beta` <br />
It requires the new eds 2.0 design tokens to be included in your app as css variables:
```tsx
//App.tsx or similar
import '@equinor/eds-tokens/css/variables.css'
```
`Text` uses the `Inter` typeface for the `body` and `ui` variants.  We will likely bundle this on the equinor EDS CDN before the full release, but for now it is available from google fonts:
```html
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com" />
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin />
<link
  href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inter:wght@100..900&display=swap"
  rel="stylesheet"
/>
```
The `header` variant currently works with the regular equinor typeface, but will later require the variable version of the equinor typeface to display properly, as the font-weights will get updated.
The equinor variable typeface is available on the EDS CDN
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.eds.equinor.com/font/equinor-font-vf.css" />
```
We will later add a new endpoint on the cdn that should include both this and `Inter`.

<label className="hide-grid-lines">
  <input className="hide-grid-lines__input" type="checkbox" />
  <Text className="sb-unstyled">hide grid lines</Text>
</label>
<Primary />
<Controls />

## Baseline grid
TODO explain this better
One of the fundamental aims of eds 2.0 spacing and typography is to achieve something called baseline grid. This is a concept of vertically aligning text and other elements in such a way where sizes and spacing always adds up to a multiple of 4px optically, thus creating a harmonious vertical rhythm.

## Usage
`Text` comes in three variants. `header` uses the `Equinor` typeface while `body` and `ui` uses `Inter`.
- `header`: For use in headings. It is important to use the `as` prop to assign the context correct header-level (`as="h3"`).
- `body`: This is the default variant, and is for use on general surfaces such as body, cards, popovers, sidesheets etc.
- `ui`: For use within UI elements such as buttons, chips, tabs etc. The text is centered within its textbox by default, but can be set to `onGrid` for cases where this makes sense. Note that for font-sizes where the cap-height happens to be a multiple of 4, there is no difference between `onGrid` true or false regardless.


```tsx
import { Text } from '@equinor/eds-core-react'
 <Text size="lg">This is text</Text>
```

## Sizes header

<Canvas of={ComponentStories.SizesHeader} />

## Sizes ui/body

<Canvas of={ComponentStories.Sizes} />

## Trunkated
Use `lines` to clamp number of lines
