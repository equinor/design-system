# Heading
This component is currently available in the beta release of eds-core-React: <br />
`npm install @equinor/eds-core-react@beta` <br />
It requires the new eds 2.0 design tokens to be included in your app as css variables:
```tsx
//App.tsx or similar
import '@equinor/eds-tokens/css/variables.css'
```
`Heading` currently works with the regular equinor font, but will later require the variable version of the equinor font to display properly, as the font-weights will get updated.
The equinor variable font is available on the EDS CDN
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.eds.equinor.com/font/equinor-font-vf.css" />
```
But we will later add a new endpoint on the cdn that should include both this and `Inter` which is the font used by `BodyText` and `UIText`
<label className="hide-grid-lines">
  <input className="hide-grid-lines__input" type="checkbox" />
  <UIText className="sb-unstyled">Hide grid lines</UIText>
</label>
<Primary />
<Controls />

## Usage
Unlike `BodyText` and` UIText`, `Heading` requires the `as` prop to be explicitly set, since in most cases it should be assigned the semantically correct headerlevel.

```tsx
import { Heading } from '@equinor/eds-core-react'
 <Heading size="6xl" as="h1">This is a title</Heading>
```

## Sizes

<Canvas of={ComponentStories.Sizes} />
