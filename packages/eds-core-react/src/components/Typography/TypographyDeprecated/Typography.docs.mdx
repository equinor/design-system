# Typography
⚠️ **`Typography` will soon be considered deprecated. This component is being replaced by `Heading`, `BodyText` and `UIText`.**

Presents hierarchy and organises information as clearly and efficiently as possible,
therefore text sizes and styles were developed to balance content density and reading comfort.

## Usage

**Typeface**

The `Equinor` typeface is not included in `EDS` by default. It is available from the EDS CDN.

<ul>
  <li>All the fonts:</li>
</ul>

```tsx
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.eds.equinor.com/font/equinor-font.css" />
```

<ul>
  <li>Individual font:</li>
</ul>

```tsx
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.eds.equinor.com/font/equinor-regular.css" />
```

The `Equinor` typeface is the primary typeface and is available in four weights:

<ul>
  <li><code>light</code>,</li>
  <li><code>regular</code>,</li>
  <li><code>medium</code>,</li>
  <li><code>bold</code>,</li>
  <li>with accompanying <code>italics</code>.</li>
</ul>

Please do not use <code>light</code> in digital interfaces except in special cases where the font size is over <code>48px</code>.

**Paragraph**

<ul>
  <li>Paragraph length is the number of characters in a line of text, this includes spaces.</li>
  <li>To ensure readability, line length should be 55-80 characters.</li>
</ul>

**Component**

```tsx
import { Typography } from '@equinor/eds-core-react'

<Typography>Sample text</Typography>
```

## Overview

Typography groups with included varints:  

Example: `<Typography group="input" variant="label"></Typography>`. <br />
Variants under `heading` and `paragraph` don’t require the group parameter.

<Canvas of={ComponentStories.GroupsOverview} />

## Examples

### Colors

<Canvas of={ComponentStories.Colors} />

### Token property

The `token` property allows you to set the token used in `Typography` instead of using `group`/`variant`. You can use the `typography` tokens from [@equinor/eds-tokens](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@equinor/eds-tokens).

#### Typography token model

```tsx
const myToken = {
    textAlign,
    textDecoration,
    textTransform,
    fontFamily,
    fontSize,
    fontStyle,
    fontWeight,
    fontFeature,
    color,
    lineHeight,
    letterSpacing,
}
```

<Canvas of={ComponentStories.TokenProperty} />

### Lines

<Canvas of={ComponentStories.Lines} />

### Link
Link used in body of text.

<Canvas of={ComponentStories.Link} />

### Using the 'as' prop to render as another component

The `as` prop allows you to render `Typography` as another html element or react component. Note that if Typography has been extended with styled-comopnents `styled(Typography)`, `forwardedAs` should be used instead of `as`.

<Canvas of={ComponentStories.As} />

This is useful if you want to use `Typography` with a third party routing library such as react-router.

```tsx
import { Link } from "react-router-dom"
import { Typography } from '@equinor/eds-core-react'

<Typography as={Link} to="/about" link>About</Typography>
```
