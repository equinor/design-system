/**
 * TypographyNext component for flexible typography with baseline grid support.
 *
 * Provides full control over typography properties including family, size,
 * lineHeight, baseline alignment, weight, and tracking.
 *
 * **Display behavior:** Elements render as `display: block` by default for
 * text-box trimming and baseline grid alignment. Override with CSS if needed.
 *
 * @example
 * ```tsx
 * import { TypographyNext as Typography } from '@equinor/eds-core-react'
 *
 * <Typography
 *   family="ui"
 *   size="md"
 *   lineHeight="default"
 *   baseline="grid"
 *   weight="normal"
 *   tracking="normal"
 * >
 *   Text content (renders as block-level by default)
 * </Typography>
 *
 * <Typography
 *   as="h1"
 *   family="header"
 *   size="3xl"
 *   lineHeight="squished"
 *   baseline="grid"
 *   weight="bolder"
 *   tracking="tight"
 * >
 *   Page heading
 * </Typography>
 * ```
