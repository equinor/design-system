## Usage

`SideSheet` is surfaces containing supplementary content.

<ul>
    <li>Side sheets contain content that supplements the screen’s primary UI region.</li>
    <li>Side sheets display a wide variety of content and layouts.</li>
    <li>Side sheets can be visible or hidden based on screen size or user need.</li>
</ul>

```tsx
import { SideSheet } from '@equinor/eds-core-react'

<SideSheet>
  // your content here
</SideSheet>
```

## Examples

### Placement

<ul>
  <li>Side sheets are anchored to the right edge of the screen.</li>
  <li>Side sheets typically span the height of the screen.</li>
  <li>Side sheets can display a wide variety of content and layouts, ranging from a list of actions to supplemental content in a tabular layout.</li>
</ul>

<Canvas of={ComponentStories.Placement} />

### Scrollable

To open `SideSheet` press <Icon name="more_vertical" size={18} color="#007079" /> icon.

<ul>
  <li>Side sheets can be vertically scrolled independent of the rest of the UI.</li>
  <li>Side sheets scroll position allows contents to persist while the page is scrolled, and vice versa.</li>
  <li>Side sheets cannot be horizontally scrolled.</li>
</ul>

<Canvas of={ComponentStories.Scrollable} />

### Draggable width

`SideSheet` does not have a built in resize with mouse drag, but this can be implemented from the outside, as shown in this example.

<Canvas of={ComponentStories.Draggable} />
