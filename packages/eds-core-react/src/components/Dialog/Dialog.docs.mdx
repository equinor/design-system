# Dialog

Informs users about a task and can contain critical information, requires decisions, or involves multiple tasks, in a layer above the page.

## Usage

Dialogs disable all app functionality when they appear, and remain on screen until confirmed, dismissed, or a required action has been taken.
Dialogs are purposefully interruptive, so they should be used sparingly.

<ul>
    <li>Dialogs <strong>focus</strong> user attention to ensure their content is addressed.</li>
    <li>Dialogs should be <strong>direct</strong> in communicating information and dedicated to completing a assignment.</li>
    <li>Dialogs should appear in response to a user task or an action, with suitable or contextual information.</li>
</ul>

 ```tsx
import { Dialog } from '@equinor/eds-core-react'

<Dialog />
```
