# About EDS 2.0 (Beta)

Welcome to the next generation of the Equinor Design System! 🎉

## What is EDS 2.0?

EDS 2.0 is a complete redesign of our component library, bringing:

- ✨ **Updated design foundations** - New spacing scales, color system, and typography built with CSS variables
- 🎨 **Pure CSS styling** - Moved away from styled-components to vanilla CSS
- 🌗 **Flexible theming** - Support for dark mode and density modes (spacious/comfortable) via `data-*` attributes
- 🎯 **Enhanced accessibility** - Improved WCAG 2.1 AA compliance across all components
- 🚀 **Better performance** - Optimized with modern React patterns and reduced bundle size
- 🔧 **Refined APIs** - Cleaner, more intuitive component interfaces

<br />
## Current Status: Beta

All components in the **"EDS 2.0"** section are currently in **beta testing**. This means:

- ⚠️ **Breaking changes may occur** - APIs are not yet finalized
- 🧪 **Testing phase** - We're gathering feedback and iterating
- 📝 **Documentation evolving** - Stories and examples are being refined
- 🎨 **Design alignment ongoing** - Ensuring perfect match with Figma

<br />
## How to Use Beta Components

<br />

### 1. Browse in Storybook

You can explore all EDS 2.0 components right here in Storybook! Components are organized under the **"EDS 2.0"** section in the sidebar.

Each component has:
- 📖 Interactive documentation
- 🎮 Live playground to test props
- 🎨 Design examples and use cases
- 🔍 Code snippets for implementation

### 2. Install Beta Version

To actually use these components in your application, install the beta version:

```bash
npm install @equinor/eds-core-react@beta
```

### 3. Import from `/next` Entry Point

```typescript
import { Button, Typography } from '@equinor/eds-core-react/next'

function MyApp() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Typography>Welcome to EDS 2.0!</Typography>
      <Button>Click me</Button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

## When Will EDS 2.0 Be Stable?

EDS 2.0 components will graduate to stable in a **single major release (v3.0.0)** when:

- ✅ All components are implemented and tested
- ✅ Design team has approved final implementations
- ✅ Real-world usage has validated the APIs
- ✅ Documentation and migration guides are complete

This approach ensures:
- 🎯 One clear migration point for all users
- 📝 Complete migration guide covering all changes
- 🔄 Simple import path change (no component renaming)
<br />
## Migration Path

When EDS 2.0 graduates to stable:

```typescript
// Before (beta testing):
import { Button } from '@equinor/eds-core-react/next'

// After (v3.0.0 stable):
import { Button } from '@equinor/eds-core-react'
```

That's it! No component name changes, just update the import path.

<br />
## CSS

CSS is **automatically included** when you import from `/next`. For SSR frameworks that need separate CSS:

```tsx
import '@equinor/eds-core-react/next/index.min.css'
```
