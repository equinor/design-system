Design tokens
=============

The design tokens in this folder are exported from the [Figma Tokens][ft] plugin in Figma. While it is _possible_ to edit the tokens in JSON, the preferred way to edit them is through the use of the plugin.

The tokens will eventually be made available on CDN and NPM, but for now theyâ€™re intended for the EDS Core Team in the work with EDS 2.0.

To use the plugin:

1. Open the plugin in Figma, and choose Github for `token storage`.
1. Add new credentials
1. Generate a personal access token on Github with the `repo` scope for the `access token` field
1. Add `equinor/design-system` as repository
1. Add `packages/eds-tokens/src/tokens` as `file path`
