Sometimes your solution will take extended time to load data. In such cases, it is important to advice the user that data is actually being loaded. In many cases, applying skeleton states may is advantegeous.

A skeleton state may be a very simplified view of a component with no actual data in it. Skeleton states should only appear for a short time, and disappear once the actual data starts appearing.

The skeleton state of a component is stripped down version of the component. Some motion is used to indicate the actual loading process to the user.

The most common use for a skeleton state is structured information, such as tables, cards, and structures lists. For other elements, such as text, images etc a whitespace or negative area will do.

## Progressive loading strategy

When loading a data heavy page, setting up progressive loading in batches should be considered. Typically, you will be able to render the whole page in 2-3 batches. Prioritise finishing the first batch before starting the next. Skeleton states should be set up for the first batch first.
