## Design and production

Missing a product icon? You can make it following these simple guidelines. 

* All product icons should be unique - so before you create a new one, make for sure that there is not an exsisting icon in the library under a different name. Search for keyword(s) assciated with the icon you are missing to ensure it is not already in the library. 
  * Reuse icons when appropriate, however, if the product icon might cause confusion between products consider creating a new, noticably different product icon. 
* All icon should be understandable regardless of language or location. 


## Style


Our icons are constructed using simple single colour keylines with no colour fill. To reflect the rounded corners of the logo product icons have rounded corners and line ends.

Each icon needs to be reduced to its minimal form being bold, geometrical and symetrical. To reflect the rounded corners of the logo, icons neeed to have rounded corners of 1 pixels. To reflect the brand, icons use a consistent stroke of 1 pixels - this inculdes curves, angles and both interior and exterior strokes. 

The EDS icons are always faceing forward and never rotated or dimensional. The icons are made for legebility and are not too literal or complex, neither are they overly playfull or bubbly.

**Don'ts**

* Do not create product icons that are filled, always use outlines.
* Do not create product icons that contain multiple colors. 
* Do not use multiple stroke weights. 
* Do not apply square corners or square line ends. 
* Do not create product icon with multiple objects. 
* Do not create product icon with hands holding objects.


**Exceptions**

Optical corrections are not allowed in product icons.


## Making a new icon

* Create an artboard that is 48 x 48 pixels. 
  * Place the `.Product icon grid`from the Utilites page in Assets in the background
  * Choose the grid shape circle, square, verticle rectangle or horizontal rectangle.
  * Lock the grid layer and start to build your icon.
  * Make sure to align all artwork to the pixel grid.
  * :warning: Examples of grid coming soon
* Line tool vs shape
  * Never use center borders - centering can cause half pixels. 
  * If you using borders or the line tool make 100% for sure to outline (expand) the icon. 


## Submitting your new icon

* When your icon has been created, delete the `.Product icon grid` layer that you had locked. 
* Make sure your icon is not grouped or nested. 
* Make sure all your layers are named logically. 
* Make sure to name the icon what it is - avoid interperative names that will make the icon hard to search and find. 
  * If you make a filled icon to suplement the outlined icon, both icons need to have this stated in their name. For example, `add circle filled` and `add circle outlined`
* Pick a category for the icon to live under. Refernce the library for current categories.
* :warning: More information to come about submitting process.
