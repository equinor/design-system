**The logo is used with care to brand interfaces**
<!--One to two sentences as an introduction to the component-->

## Guidelines
<!--List how to use it, sizes, widths, grid interactions, color allowances -->

For internal interfaces, the Equinor logo is used sparingly as users have already logged into the Equinor network. The logo, star symbol and favicon can be used in `Energy Red` or `White`. Always use the logo spacing that is provided --- it is build into each component. This ensures the logo maintains its visual integrity. 



### Not for: 
<!--Bullet point list if needed -->

* Do not use the logo in `Energy Red` over a black background. 
* Do not use the logo over photography.
* Do not add any shadows, gradients, outlines or lighting effects. 
* Do not change the proportions, rotate or tilt the logo.
* The logo should not be used as a link in internal interfaces. This can cause confusion as the logo could be thought to link to equinor.com. 



## Variations 


<!--One ### heading per frame in Figma, explaining each component in that frame. One 'content' section per variation if needed -->


### Main logo

:warning: Collapsible mega embed coming soon

The preferred use of branding with the logo for internal interfaces is via splash screens. For interfaces, only the horizontal logo is used and it must have a minimum height of 48px.


### Star symbol

:warning: Collapsible mega embed coming soon

The Equinor star can be used on splash screens and in animations. The Equinor star cannot be used as an app icon, as it is used for the main Equinor app icon - all other apps should have unique icons.


### Favicon

The favicon can be used at 16px or at 32px. The favicon cannot be used in any other usecases than a favicon.
