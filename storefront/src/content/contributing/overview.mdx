## Overview

The EDS has an overarching goal of creating consitent interfaces, experinces and being platform agnostic. The system serves the people using it - the designers and developers. They are the real customers and are always to be at the center of the work when contributing to the design system. If we were not to have them in mind, we would do them a diservice to their users. 

Building such a system is no easy task. There are components to research, design, test, develop, pressure test, document, bugs to fix, questions to answer and maintenance to be done - just to name a few things. 


## The EDS partnership programme

The EDS has been created for your team to use - and hopfully has elivated stress and helped your team to devlier faster. We ask that teams using the EDS contribute 5% of their time back to the EDS. Depending on your team size, that could mean one person contributing a few hours a week or a day a month. This is not something unique to the EDS, others like [AirBnB](https://airbnb.design/systems-thinking-unlocked/) and [WordPress](https://ma.tt/2014/09/five-for-the-future/) have programmes like this.

This 5% contribution can be in design, developement, maintenance, security, documentation, testing, traning or other things that come up over time that are needed to keep the system alive and well. Five precent is not manadatory, 5% is not the minimum or maximum you can contribute either. It is a suggestion to help keep the system you are relying on alive. Those using the system daily are the ones that will know it best inside and out - so it is fitting that they will be the ones to help nuture it and keep it healthy.
