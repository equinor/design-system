Notes.
- Always start to make every component in a frame (aka: artboard). 
- Component grids use a custom color of #000FF at 25% for lines, and 10% for columns/rows. This allows the users of the EDS to see the default red grids apart from compoenent girds. 
- Make sure in Figma, under Preferences that Snap to geometry/object/grid are all on. 
- In Figma, under Preferences - set your 'Nudge amount' to 8px.
