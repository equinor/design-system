# Introduction

The Equinor Design System is built using Figma. The first thing you need to do as a designer that will use the EDS, is to get to know Figma.


## Don't make your own

Please refrain from spending resources making your own design system.
Equinor Design System is expect to be used by default for all new projects, over time existing systems may be expected to convert to the EDS.

## Study the accessibility guidelines

Our accessibility guidelines are an easy read and we advise you to read them before designing page templates.
