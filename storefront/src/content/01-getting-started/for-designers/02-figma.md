Using, choosing, following 
Buttons are set
Icons you can pick - from token colors



## Clickbounds hidden by default

When starting to use Figma, you might wonder why some components, such as buttons, have a larger bounding box than visual presence. 
There is a layer called the clickbound, which is 48px in height - this is in accordance with the WCAG guidelines for touch targets and rounded up 4px to sit nicely on the 8-grid.


## Placeholders 

When putting together layouts, you can add a placeholder where you don't have content ready. 
Some compnenents from the EDS, such as buttons, will use this placeholder for the icons in the button. 
From the library you can drag the icon you want over the button to replace the placeholder by:
- Mac: Ctrl + Apple key
- PC: Ctrl + Alt
