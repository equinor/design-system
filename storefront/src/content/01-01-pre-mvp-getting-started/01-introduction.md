# Introduction

The Equinor Design System (EDS) is a collection of reusable components that can be assembled in different combinations to design and build any number of products, apps, and web-applications.
All components are high-quality, prodcution-grade and accessibility-tested. 
This allows Equinor to manage design at scale by creating a single source of truth for teams to design, prototype and develop.

The EDS is being built for new projects. A "new project" is considered a project that is started after the first version on the EDS is released. 

_The EDS core team has the flexibility to continuously revise and expand upon components to suit chainging needs._


## Goals

**People first**  
The EDS will create a visual UI languge that is based on standard UI patterns for real people.

**Efficient**  
Rather than focusing on pixels, teams should both be able to rely on the system to work for them allowing them to focus on greater experiences, challenging interactions and complex logic. 

**Collaborative**  
The EDS is open for all teams working in or with design and development at Equinor. Everyone is encouraged to [contribute](link).


## Principles

**Flexible**  
Built to be flexible. Its components are designed to work smoothly with each other. 

**Accessible**  
It's designed and developed to be accessible to everyone - regardless of their ability or situation.

**Meaningful motion**  
Motion is used to focus attention and is not decorative. 

**Cross-platform**  
Maintain the same UI across plaforms - using shared components, tokens and guidelines.
