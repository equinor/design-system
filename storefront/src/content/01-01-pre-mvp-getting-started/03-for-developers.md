# For developers

The EDS provides the official UI components for all of Equinor's internal products, apps, and web-applications.
Developers should use the EDS to easily sew togetgher new protopyes, while focusing on application logic rather than front-end components.
There will be two different inplementations built that will be started and maintained by the core EDS team - with futher development from the Equinor Developement community.

1. Clean CSS library 
2. A React library 

The CSS + React libraries will be avaliable via NPM.


## While you wait
 
Continue using the same tools and languages as you have been. 
Components will be implemented based on the principles of open source and social coding. 
Once the first design package is ready, a subset of the designed components will be built by the core team. 
When that subset is ready, all developers will be both invited and encouraged to crowdsource the implementation.


## How to help

When the EDS is released, every component will have a corresponding issue on Github with implementation details. 
If you need to use a component in your product, app, or web-application that's not implemented yet, we invite you to contribute to the component library. 
Implement the component according to the specification, then make a pull request that will be reviewed by the EDS Core Team.


## Distribution

We aim to make upgrading to the EDS as smooth as possible.
Your team can choose to integrate with the EDS via CDN or a Package Manager.
