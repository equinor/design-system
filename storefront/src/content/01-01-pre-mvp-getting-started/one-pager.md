# Introduction

The Equinor Design System (EDS) will be a collection of reusable components that can be assembled in different combinations to design and build any number of products, apps, and web-applications.
All deisgn and code components will be high-quality, prodcution-grade and accessibility-tested. 
This will allow Equinor to manage design at scale by creating a single source of truth for teams to design, prototype and develop.

The EDS is being built for new projects. A "new project" is a project that is started after the first version on the EDS is released. 


## For designers

The EDS will be the offical UI languge for all of Equinor's internal products, apps, and web-applications. 
It includes reources to create consistent user interfaces for Equinor based of of it's guidelines and components.
The first release will include a selection of Design Tokens, Assets, and Desktop UI. 


### While you wait 

Continue using the same tools and processes as you have been. 

Still eager to prepare? Familiarise yourself with [Figma](https://www.figma.com) - this will be your tool for designing and prototyping within the EDS. 
Figma Organisation Licenses will be released with the first release of the EDS - more information on this will come later. 


### What is Figma

[Figma](https://www.figma.com) is a collaborative interface design tool for UI design and prototyping. 
It increases efificenty with the added flexibility of Team Libraries (The EDS) with components, styles, and fonts automatically distributed.

**Platform agnostic**  
Figma is browser based. It can also be downloaded as a stand-alone application for MacOS, Windows, Chomebook and Linux.

**Real Time Collaboration**  
Figma allows you to edit along with your team, seeing what they are doing in real time.

**Communication**  
Figma allows your team to leave contextual feedback by commenting directly in the design file.

**Prototyping**  
Figma allows you to quickly create and share your prototype to others for review or testing.

**Developement**
Figma allows your developement team to always have view access to the current files and prototypes.


## For developers

The EDS will provide the official UI components for all of Equinor's internal products, apps, and web-applications.
Developers should use the EDS to easily sew togetgher new protopyes, while focusing on application logic rather than front-end components.
There will be two different inplementations built that will be started and maintained by the core EDS team - hopefully with futher development from the Equinor Developement Community.

1. Clean CSS library 
2. A React library 

The CSS + React libraries will be avaliable via NPM.


### While you wait
 
Continue using the same tools as you have been. 
Once the first design package is ready, a subset of the designed components will be built by the core team. 
When that subset is ready, all developers will be both invited and encouraged to help with the implementation.


### Upgrading

We aim to make upgrading to the EDS as smooth as possible.
Your team can choose to integrate with the EDS via CDN or a Package Manager.
