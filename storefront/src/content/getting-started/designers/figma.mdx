## What is Figma

Figma is a collaborative interface design tool for UI design and prototyping. It increases efficiency with the added flexibility of team libraries (the EDS) with components, styles and fonts automatically distributed.

**Platform agnostic**  
Figma is browser-based. It can also be downloaded as a stand-alone application for MacOS, Windows, Chromebook and Linux.

**Real-time collaboration**  
Figma allows you to edit along with your team, seeing what they are doing in real-time.

**Communication**  
Figma allows your team to leave contextual feedback by commenting directly in the design file.

**Prototyping**  
Figma allows you to quickly create and share your prototype with others for review or testing.

**Development**  
Figma allows your development team to always have view access to the current files and prototypes.


## Applying to use Figma

Continue using the same tools and processes as you have been. 
Still eager to prepare? Familiarise yourself with Figma - this will be your tool for designing and prototyping within the EDS. 
The Figma Organization licences will be available to use with the EDS once it is ready - more information on this will come later.

## Grids in Figma

* Change your nudge amount to 8px
    * :warning: Info coming soon on how to do that
* Make sure to read up on grids before starting with the EDS

## Clickbounds hidden by default

When starting to use Figma, you might wonder why some components, such as buttons, have a larger bounding box than visual presence. 
There is a layer called the clickbound, which is 48px in height - this is in accordance with the WCAG guidelines for touch targets and rounded up 4px to sit nicely on the 8-grid.

## Placeholders 

When putting together layouts, you can add a placeholder where you don't have content ready. 
Some components from the EDS, such as buttons, will use this placeholder for the icons in the button. 
From the library you can drag the icon you want over the button to replace the placeholder by:
- Mac: Ctrl + Apple key
- PC: Ctrl + Alt
