The Equinor design system (EDS) will empower you to design consistently and prototype rapidly.
It is the offical interface library for all of Equinorâ€™s internal digital interfaces such as products, apps and web applications.


## Device agnostic

All components have been created for interaction on all devices. This means that all interface compnonents can be used easily by mouse, keyboard or touch input.
This should help make the EDS future-proof to new technologies.


## Please don't make your own

Please refrain from spending resources making your own design system.
The EDS is suggested for all new projects.
If there are components missing that keep you from using the EDS, consider contributing (:warning: link needed).


## Migration

:warning: More information will come soon to help prepare you to migrate your team and projects to Figma Organization and the EDS.
