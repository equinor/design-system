# Equinor design system (EDS)

The EDS is Equinor's offical design system. It provides a collection of guidelines and reusable components that can be assembled in different combinations to design and build digital interfaces.
All design and code components are high-quality, production-grade and accessibility-tested. 
This allows Equinor to manage design at scale by creating a single source of truth for teams to design, prototype and develop.


## Goals

**People first**  
The EDS creates a visual UI languge that is based on standard UI patterns for real people.

**Efficient**  
It's a reliable, working system that allows teams to focus their time on creating greater experiences, challenging interactions and complex logic. 

**Collaborative**  
The EDS is open for all teams working with design and development at Equinor. Everyone is encouraged to [contribute](link) :warning:.


## Principles 

**Flexible**  
Built to be flexible. Its components are designed to work smoothly with each other. 

**Accessible**  
It's designed and developed to be accessible to everyone - regardless of their ability or situation.

**Meaningful motion**  
Motion is used to focus attention and is not decorative. 

**Cross-platform**  
Maintains the same UI across plaforms - using shared components, tokens and guidelines.
