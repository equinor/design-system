## Guidelines
<!--List how to use it, sizes, widths, grid interactions, color allowances -->

Tooltips disappear after the mouse is no longer hovering the target area, the focus has moved on or the long-press released. The information they provide should be very short and descriptive. They explain icon meanings  helping describe differences between similar components.

Tooltips should aim to have a single line of text, that does not wrap keeping the text under 80 characters in length. The position of the tooltip is flexible. When tooltips are used on components at the edge of the frame, make sure to align them to be visible and not become cropped. They are always pointed to the component to which they give information about.


**Don't**
<!--Bullet point list if needed -->

* Do not use tooltips that restate visible UI text.
* Do not add tooltips to buttons with text. 
* Do not add rich information, such as bold or italics.
* Do not add images, such as avatars or icons.
* Do not move tooltips to follow the cursor.
* Do not have links within tooltips.
* Do not use punctuation other than a `.`in a tooltip. 
  * Tooltips are not the place for questions or excitement. 
* Do not spell out numbers, use "12" instead of "twelve"
