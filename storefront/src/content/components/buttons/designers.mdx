This will be the same for finding all compoennts in Figma. Rebecca, Should we just have a section in getting started on how to find components. Then we dont need to repeat ourselves 100x and can write here about Figma only if there is something 'strange' about the component in Figma that needs to be pointed out. 

Buttons in Figma

* In the left sidebar, choose the tab Assets
    * :warning: Image example like: https://i.imgur.com/cyt9T1Q.png
* You can then scroll to find Buttons or search for them. 
* Once you have found it, click and drag it out to the Frame you need it on.
* Do not change the colors or layouts. 
	* Only edit the Button text. 
	* If using a Button with an icon, replace the `Icon Placeholder` with the icon needed.

## Button variations


### Primary, Secondary, Danger

The EDS has Primary, Secondary and Danger buttons avaliable in the Contained, Outlined and Text variations. All variations can have an icon on the right, left, only an icon with no text and only text. When using an icon, it must be directly related to the action and label of the button. 


### Contained buttons

Contained buttons have high-emphasis and should be used for primary actions when possible. 

Do not used two contained buttons next to each other. When grouping buttons, use a outlined or text button with a contained button. 
To comply with accessibility guidelines, all interactive components must have a minimum of 8px between them. This is to prevent users from accidentally clicking the wrong place. 


### Outlined buttons

Outlined buttons have medium-emphasis and should be used for ations that are important when possible. 


### Text buttons

Text buttons have a low-emphasis and are typically used for less-important actions or multiple actions of the same importance. 

Text buttons can be placed side-by-side. To comply with accessibility guidelines, all interactive components must have a minimum of 8px between them. This is to prevent users from accidentally clicking the wrong place. 


### Buttons with a left or right icon
Buttons can used an icon to help clarify an action. Always use icons that clearly communicate their meanings. 


## Button width

Buttons have a minimum padding that is automatically built into the component. You can however strech the buttom to span one or multiple columns in width. 


## Button labels
Avoid labels that are too long. Titles should be to the point and short, no more than 3 words. 
See the Guidelines for Content (:warning: link) for guideance on using capitalization and using active words as your labels.
