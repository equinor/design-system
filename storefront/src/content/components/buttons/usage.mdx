## Figma

### How to add

Select "Assets" (:warning: link to Getting Started > Figma, Finding components) and find buttons by either scrolling to the different sections beginning with "Buttons" or searching for "button". Add the button you need by dragging it to your frame.


### How to use

Buttons can be resized, but only horizontally. When resizing always fit the width of the text to avoid line breaks. For buttons that contain icons---to change the icon, select the button, go to "Layers" (:warning: link to Getting Started > Figma, Finding components) and locate the following layer: `Enabled > Icon > Nested icon`. With this selected, go to "Instance" (:warning: link to Getting Started > Figma, Finding components) and click the name of the icon. Go to `Assets > System Icons` to locate and choose a new icon.
