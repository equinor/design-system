**Links are primarily used as interactive navigational elements, though they can also change how data is viewed.**

## Guidelines
<!--List how to use it, sizes, widths, grid interactions, color allowances -->

Links can be used on their own in body text, ordered lists, unordered lists but always as text. 


### Link vs button

A button is used when performing an action. Actions are almost always on the same page. A link is used when navigating to another place. If the action will change the data, use a button. 


### Not for: 
<!--Bullet point list if needed -->

* Links are not for actions such as "Submit" or "Create new".


## Variations 


### Link style
<!--One ### heading per frame in Figma, explaning each componnet in that frame. One 'content' section per variation if needed -->

Links are underlined and should always be in an ´Interactive colour`.


#### Content

* Links should be less than 3 words 
* Avoid terms like "Click here" --- instead, use meaningful labels that explain the destination


## Exceptions

The link style can be used without the underline when it is paired with an icon that implies interaction or when it causes unnecessary visual clutter. This does not meet all the accessibility guidelines, but is sometimes more useful to not overload visually.
