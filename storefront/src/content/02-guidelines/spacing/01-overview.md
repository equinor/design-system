# Spacing

Spacing is like whitespace, it gives air and readability to your UI. 
Spacing is used to consistently apply `margin` and `padding` across all platforms. 


Tips to Remember: 
- The EDS uses a 8px grid and 24 column layout.
- Always make sure to follow the [Accessibility Guidelines](link) by having 8px of spacing between each `clickbound`. 
- ADD A TIP ABOUT TURNING ON AND OFF THE SPACING IN FIGMA. GOOD FOR EVERYONE DEV/DESIGN TO KNOW ABOUT
