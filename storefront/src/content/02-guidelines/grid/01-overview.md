## The grid

The Equinor Design Systems follows a grid that is 8 px. All elements are to follow this rhythm.

This applies to all components used in the solution; both their positioning (generally and relative to each other) and their sizing.

Example: The vertical spacing between elements can be 8 px, 16 px, 24 px etc.

Example: Since the size of components also follow the same rhythm, their height can be 8 px, 16 px, 24 px etc.

All components delivered by the EDS follows grid principles.
