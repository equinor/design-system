## Font weight

Tweaking font weight enables you to both emphasize specific text and differentiate content within a hierarchy. Both bold and light weight can be used for such purpose, though the latter will typically have to be combined with larger text.

## Line height

Line height is set to 1,5.

## Line length

The display area of screens (viewport) may vary in size and this will ultimately affect the length of each line. Therefore, make sure your text does not depend on a certain width. Generally, wide lines of text are difficult to read. 

We recommend 55-95 characters per line.
