# Color

The EDS's defualt theme is light and airy. Follow these guidelines to build a unified and recognizable Equinor interface.  
Use the colors provided in the EDS, do not add your own. 
These are the brand colors and have been tested to make sure that when combined following these guidelines they will meet or exceed the [WCAG 2.0 Level AA Accessibility Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag). 

Tip:  
_Many people have trouble distuingishing colors from each other, so make sure color is not the only way you convey certain information._


## Interactive Colors

Moss Green has been dedicated to be the `Primary` Interactive Color for internal interfaces and experiences. 
This is different from other branding you might see in print and marketing. 
The decision was made to guarantee that there was no confusion with errors. 

Energy Red is still used as our `Secondary`color. However, use it wisely so it does not look like a error. 
For example, a contained button using Energy Red as it's background color can easily look like it is the dangerous option. 
However, a frameless button using Energy Red as the text color can provide attention while not looking dangerous.

Danger, Warning and Success

:warning: More info coming soon


## Text Colors

As you build your interfaces, you will only need to use the `Primary`text color which is used for `Headings`and for `Body`text. 
The Secondary and Tertiary text colors are nested into components that are already assembled for you. 


## UI Backgrounds

You can choose between `Default` (which is white) or `Light` and `Medium` greys for the background of your interface. 
The other 4 `UI Backgrounds` are nested into components that are already assembled for you.  

Please do not add your own background colors - the deault theme is light and airy, not allowing for "Dark Mode' at this time.


## Infographic Colors 

There are 2 sets of Infographic Colors for you to choose between - `Primary Infographic Colors` and `Substitute Infographic Colors`. 


### Primary Infographic Colors 

Aim to avoid creating multi-coloured charts and diagrams. Monochrome charts and diagrams are preferred wherever possible.  
Please take care when using reds with our blue and green palette to avoid making the red data points appear as a warning or negative data. 


### Substitute Infographic Colors

Our Substitute Infographic Colors have been developed for enhanced legibility. First use all the reds, then use all the greens beofre finally adding in all the blues. 
This palette is restricted for exceptional circumstances and only when the Primary Infographic Colors do not offer enough clarity and definition. 


## Exceptions for Interactive and Infographic Colors
If you need to use additonal colors for domain specific requirments, charts or graphs make sure to test your colors for contrast. 
This is strictly for domain specific cases and does not give approval for choosing new colors based on personal preference. 
Use high contrast, as this is both increases readability in general and includes users with impaired seeing.
