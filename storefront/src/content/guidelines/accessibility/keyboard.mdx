# Keyboard

For users who rely on or prefer using a keyboard, screen reader or voice - it is important to provide functionality that shows focus on all interactive content.
Many users navigate using only their keyboard by `tabbing` between focusable elements to navigate and select content by using the `enter`key or using the `spacebar` to activate an in-focus element. 
The user's focus should never move without their actions causing the movement. 

When focus is done right, it allows keyboard navigation, voice navigation and screen readers to easily reach the next step. In the EDS we use the `Interactive State/Default/Focused` to show focus around an element. 
This is our visual indicator and has been designed to have contrast to other elements within the interface.


## Navigation Order 

Place components on the page in order of importance - the order that element recieve focus should be logical and predicatable. Try to keep navigation to a minimum of steps and make all steps clear.

Try navigating your own solution by only using a keyboard. Can you naviagate? Can you perform all the important tasks? Can you tell where the keyboard focus is? 
Do your items follow the order you think? Generally, focus travels up to down, left to right. Test it out by using your `tab`key.


## Shortcuts

It is important to enable the users to become more efficient as they get more familiar with the interface. 
Both regarding ergonomic issues, like preventing carpal tunnel syndrome, but also to avoid stress and frustration to the user while having to do slow and repetitive tasks over and over again.
Keyboard shortcuts should be promoted so that the user easily can adopt them on the way. 
One way of promoting keyboard shortcuts is in the relevant context in menus and tooltips. 

- The `esc`key should always be used to cancel or close.  
- The `enter`key should always be used to submit, select or expand
