The EDS's default theme is light and airy. Follow these guidelines to build a unified and recognisable Equinor interface.  
Use the colours provided in the EDS, do not add your own. 
These are the brand colours and have been tested to make sure that when combined following these guidelines they will meet or exceed the [WCAG 2.0 Level AA Accessibility Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag). 

Tip:  
_Many people have trouble differentiating certain colours, so make sure colour is not the only way to convey certain information._


## Interactive colours

Moss Green is dedicated to be the `Primary` interactive colour for internal digital interfaces and experiences. 
This is different from other branding you might see in print and marketing. The decision was made to guarantee that there is no confusion with errors. 

Slate Blue is dedicated to be the `Secondary` colour. 

Energy Red is strategically not used since it is easy to misunderstand as an error or alert colour.


### Feedback colours

Feedback colours for danger (red), warning (orange) and success (green) are also available for use.

## Text colours

As you build your interfaces, you will only need to use the `Primary` text colour which is used for `Headings` and for `Body` text. 
The secondary and tertiary text colours are nested into components that are already assembled.


## UI backgrounds

You can choose between `Default` (which is white) or `Light` and `Medium` greys for the background of your interface. 
The other four `UI Backgrounds` are nested into components that are already assembled for you.  

Please do not add your own background colours - the default theme is light and airy and does not allow for "dark mode' at this time.


## Infographic colours 

There are two sets of infographic colours for you to choose between - `Primary Infographic Colors` and `Substitute Infographic Colors`. 


### Primary infographic colours 

Aim to avoid creating multi-coloured charts and diagrams. Monochrome charts and diagrams are preferred wherever possible. Please take care when using reds with blue and green colours to avoid making the red data points appear as a warning or negative data. 


### Substitute infographic colours

The `Substitute Infographic Colors` have been developed for enhanced legibility. First use all the reds, then use all the greens before finally adding in all the blues. 
These colours are restricted for exceptional circumstances and only when the `Primary Infographic Colors` do not offer enough clarity and definition. 


## Exceptions for interactive and infographic colours

If you need to use additional colours for domain-specific requirements, charts or graphs - make sure to test your colours for contrast. 
This is strictly for domain-specific cases and does not give approval for choosing new colours based on personal preferences. 
Use high contrast colours, as this both increases general readability and includes the needs of users with impaired vision.
