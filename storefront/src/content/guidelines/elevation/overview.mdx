**Elevation is a visual effect that makes an element look like it's floating above the surface (using the z-axis).**
<!--One to two sentences as an introduction to the component-->

***

## Guidelines
<!--List how to use it, sizes, widths, grid interactions, color allowances -->

The elevation effect is made using shadows to help lift an element into focus --- it is a reference to the physical world. Elements may be stacked on top of each other, but can’t pass through each other.


**Don't**
<!--Bullet point list if needed -->

* Do not use elevation on icons. 
* Do not use elevation on text.


## Styles 
<!--One ### heading per frame in Figma, explaining each component in that frame. One 'content' section per variation if needed -->

There are six elevations to choose between: **None**, **Raised**, **Overlay**, **Sticky**, **Temporary nav** and **Above scrim**.
