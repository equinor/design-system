# Typography overview

## Equinor Typeface

The Equinor typeface is our primary typeface and is available in four weights: `light`, `regular`, `medium` and `bold` with accompanying italics. 
We do not recommend using `light` in digital interfaces unless it is a specaial case where the font size is over 48px. 


## Paragraph length

Paragraph length is the number of characters in a line of text - this includes spaces. 
To ensure readability, line length should be between 55 - 80 characters. 
Lines less than 55 characters can cause strain on the eye requiring the eye to jump to the next line to quickly, breaking the reading rhythm. 
Lines greater than 80 characters can make it difficult for user to continure on the correct line in a large body of text.


## Sizes Available

Too many type sizes can cause confusion for your users. The EDS has a limited set of type sizes that work well with eachother.
