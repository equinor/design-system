## Figma

### How to add

Select "Assets" (:warning: link to Getting Started > Figma, Finding components) and find the spacing component by either scrolling to the section called "Spacing" or searching for "spacing". Expand either "Horizontal" and "Vertical" and drag the relevant sized spacing in.


### How to use

Resize the spacing component by dragging the component from one end while _not_ holding shift. "Horizontal" components will only be resizable horizontally and "Vertical" components will only be resizable horizontally.
