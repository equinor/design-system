## Figma

### How to add

Select [Assets :warning:](), find the spacing component by either scrolling to the section called "Spacing" or searching for "Spacing". Expand either the "Horizontal" and "Vertical" sections and drag the relevant sized spacing into the frame.


### How to use

Resize the spacing component by dragging the component from one end while _not_ holding shift. "Horizontal" components will only be resizable horizontally and "Vertical" components will only be resizable vertically.
