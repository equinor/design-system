# Trigger Package Publishing Workflow
#
# This workflow automatically publishes packages to npm after a release PR is merged (release_please.yml).
# It detects which packages had version changes and triggers the appropriate publish workflows.
#
# Flow:
# 1. Release PR is merged → this workflow runs
# 2. Checks which package versions changed in .release-please-manifest.json
# 3. Triggers individual publish workflows only for changed packages
# 4. Each publish workflow handles: building, testing, npm publish, and Storybook deployment
