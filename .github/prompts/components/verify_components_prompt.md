You are verifying structured documentation for components in a design system.â€¨Don't output tables. List out as bullet points.
Your task is to evaluate the documentation against the following criteria:

1. **Clarity and Understandability**

- Is the description of the component clear and easy to understand?
- Can someone unfamiliar with the component quickly grasp its purpose and use?

2. **Completeness**

- Are the key sections present? (Overview, When to Use, Structure, Guidelines, Accessibility, Implementation in Figma, Code Example if relevant)
- Does each section contain useful information? Note what is missing.

3. **Tone of Voice**

- Is the tone friendly, approachable, and professional?
- Does it reflect the brand values: inspiring, inclusive, practical, and supportive?

4. **Consistency**

- Is the structure consistent across different components?
- Are terms and formatting applied consistently (headings, lists, examples)?

5. **Redundancy or Noise**

- Are there duplicated or unnecessary paragraphs?
- Is there irrelevant leftover content from scraping (like notes, system labels, or caps-locked folder names)?

6. **Practical Usability**

- Would a designer or developer be able to use this documentation to work with the component in Figma and code?
- Is there enough detail to take action?
