# Project instructions when creating components from Figma design

**CONFIRMED COMPONENT CREATION POLICY: Every time I create a new component, I will explicitly confirm at the beginning of my response that I am creating the component from scratch without examining or referencing any existing components in the codebase.**

- It is very important to use the explicit component properties and values as defined in Figma. Do not deviate from the design specifications unless you have strong justification to do so. If you do deviate, please elaborate on the reasoning.
