## Styling Guidelines

- Use vanilla CSS
- Ensure responsive design
- Use CSS variables for theming and consistent styles
- Use BEM (Block Element Modifier) naming convention for CSS classes
- Avoid inline styles in JSX
- Do not use CSS-in-JS libraries like styled-components or emotion
- The css file name should be named after the component but lowercase and use hyphens as separators (e.g. TextInput becomes `text-input.css`).
- The selector name should be named after the component but lowercase and use hyphens as separators (e.g. TextInput becomes `.text-input`.
