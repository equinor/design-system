import { TopBar, Icon, Search } from '@equinor/eds-core-react'

The top bar, also known as a header, displays navigation and actions relating to the interface.

<!--One to two sentences as an introduction to the component-->

## Guidelines

<!--List how to use it, sizes, widths, grid interactions, color allowances -->

Top bars span the full width of the viewport and are always the topmost component on a page. The top bar does not scroll away, being a consistent guidepost to users.

/>

**Don't**

<!--Bullet point list if needed -->

- Do not hide the top bar when scrolling.
- Do not change the colour of the top bar.
- Do not add the `Logo` in the top bar.
- Do not add imagery in the top bar.

## Sections

<!--One ### heading per frame in Figma, explaining each component in that frame. One 'content' section per variation if needed -->

### Title and navigation

The top bar always has a title which is the same throughout the whole application group. A subtitle is allowed, this can be the same throughout the whole application group, or can be specific to sub-apps within the application.

The top bar has one _optional_ main navigational icon button which is always to the far left. This icon can either open the `App launcher` or toggle the `Navigation Drawer`.

### Center custom content

The center block of the top bar can either be left empty, or custom content can be inserted into the placeholder.

#### Custom content allowed:

- Tabs
  - Tabs are allowed with nested menus
- Search bars
- Buttons as menus

### Actions

The actions on the far-right are standard. This area is for the following common actions within the application:

- Fullscreen: Users can choose to launch the interface to be fullscreen.
- Notifications: This opens a `Menu` for the user to see their notifications.
- Accessibility: This opens a `Menu` with choices for the users to choose light/dark mode and their font size. _This button is mandatory to keep._
- User profile: This opens a `Menu` where the user can see more account details and log out. _This button is mandatory to keep._
