import { Chip } from '@equinor/eds-core-react'

## Figma

### How to add

1. Locate the **Assets** tab in the **Layers Panel**.
2. There are two ways to locate the `Chip` component needed:
   - Use the search bar to search for a component grouping name or variation name.
   - Scroll through the folders list and open the relevant grouping.
3. Once the component needed is located, click and drag it into the frame/artboard.

### How to use

1. Select the `Chip` in the frame/artboard.
2. Locate and expand the highlighted _layer_ in the **Layers Panel**.
3. Edit the Label. If the text wraps over one line, resize the width of the chip to avoid line breaks.
4. Never add height to chips, only resize them horizontally in width.
5. For chips that contain a nested icon:
   - Locate and select the `Icon > Nested icon > Placeholder Icon` _layer_ in the **Layers Panel**.
   - Locate the **Design** tab in the **Inspector Panel**.
   - Under the **Instance** section, click the icon name to expand the menu.
   - Choose a new icon.
6. For chips that contain an avatar:
   - Locate and select the `Avatar circle` _layer_ in the **Layers Panel**.
   - Locate the **Design** tab in the **Inspector Panel**.
   - Under the **Fill** section, click on the **Image** to expand the image options menu.
   - Hover over the current image and click **Choose image...** to select a new image.
