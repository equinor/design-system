import { Dialog } from '@equinor/eds-core-react'

## Figma

### How to add

1. Locate the **Assets** tab in the **Layers Panel**.
2. There are two ways to locate the `Dialog` component needed:
   - Use the search bar to search for a component grouping name or variation name.
   - Scroll through the folders Dialog and open the relevant grouping.
3. Once the component is located, click and drag it into the frame/artboard.

### How to use

1. Place the `Dialog` at the top of your frame/artboard.
2. Locate the **Design** tab in the **Inspector Panel**.
3. Edit the content sections:
   - Title: Triple-click on the title to edit.
   - Text: Triple-click on the text to edit.
   - Placeholder content: Build your own components to swap with the nested `Placeholder` instance if needed.
   - Actions: Place and align `Buttons` in the action area, then turn off the action placeholder.
4. Make sure to turn off any `Placeholder` _layers_ that are not used.
