import { Button } from '@equinor/eds-core-react/dist/core-react.cjs.js'

## Figma

### How to add

1. Locate the **Assets** tab in the **Layers Panel**.
2. There are two ways to locate the `Button` component needed:
   - Use the search bar to search for a component grouping name or variation name.
   - Scroll through the folders list and open the grouping.
3. Once the component needed is located, click and drag it into the frame/artboard.

### How to use

1. Select the `Button` in the frame/artboard.
2. Locate and expand the highlighted _layer_ in the **Layers Panel**.
3. Edit the text. If the text wraps over one line, resize the width of the button to avoid line breaks.
4. Never add height to _buttons_, only resize them horizontally in width.
5. For _buttons_ that contain a nested icon:
   - Locate and select the `Icon > Nested icon > Placeholder Icon` _layer_ in the **Layers Panel**.
   - Locate the **Design** tab in the **Inspector Panel**.
   - Under the **Instance** section, click the icon name to expand the menu.
   - Choose a new icon.
