_Steppers_ guide users through the steps of a task.

<!--One to two sentences as an introduction to the component-->

## Guidelines

<!--List how to use it, sizes, widths, grid interactions, colour allowances -->

When a task is more advanced or complicated, visual help from a stepper lets the user know where they are in the current process.

**Don't**

<!--Bullet point list if needed -->

- Do not use with less than three steps.

## Content

- Avoid titles that are too long. Titles should be to the point and short, no more than three words if possible.
- Keep the item labels as short as possible.
- Use meaningful item labels that explain the function.
- Item labels should be in the active tense.
- Do not mix nouns and verbs. Pick one or the other.
- Always use icons that clearly communicate their intended purpose.

## Variant

<!--One ### heading per frame in Figma, explaining each component in that frame. One 'content' section per variation if needed -->
