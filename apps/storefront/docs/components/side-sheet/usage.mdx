import { SideSheet } from '@equinor/eds-core-react'

## Figma

### How to add

1. Locate the **Assets** tab in the **Layers Panel**.
2. There are two ways to locate the `Side sheet` component needed:
   - Use the search bar to search for a component grouping name or variation name.
   - Scroll through the folders list and open the relevant grouping.
3. Once the component is located, click and drag it into the frame/artboard.

### How to use

1. Place the `Side sheet`.
2. Toggle the grid layout on/off by using the following shortcut:

- Mac: `Control` + `G`
- PC: `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `4`

4. Stack content components above the `Side sheet`, making sure to follow the grid within.
5. Select all the layers and convert them to a frame/artboard by using the following shortcut:

- Mac: `Command` + `Option` + `G`
- PC: `Ctrl` + `ALT` + `G`

6. Make sure to name the new group.
7. Locate the **Design** tab in the **Inspector Panel**.
8. Under the **Constraints** section, set up constraints.
   9 If the sidesheet is elevated, apply `Elevation/Overlay` to the whole grouped layer.
