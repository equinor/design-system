Specific loading components may be used when indicating to the user that data is being processed. This may typically be used when loading takes quite some time (from a couple of seconds to a minute), or when user data is being saved/submitted. There are two main types of uses for loading components: Large and inline.

## Large loading

Apply this whenever the entire page is processing, typically when submitting user input.

## Inline loading

This is a single component that indicates loading, and is placed within its context. Typical use may be when a user restarting or pausing a micro operation.
