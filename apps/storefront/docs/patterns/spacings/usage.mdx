**Using the correct spacing throughout your design will provide consistency to your product.**

## Guidelines

Using a grid as a starting point for your component implementation will help you arrange your content into structured proportions. You also have to keep in mind that EDS is based on an 8px ratio. This means that you always have to keep a minimum of 8px beetween objects and elements. Please read the [spacing page](https://eds.equinor.com/guidelines/spacing/) for general guidelines.

## Best practices

### Spacing according to buttons

#### Spacing between buttons
Button pairs such as “Continue” and “Cancel” are used with 8px spacing between each button. Buttons with no connection are used with at least 16px spacing between them.

#### Buttons below components
Buttons placed below a form or table with a connection to the form or table should have a spacing of 8px. 

#### Buttons next to other components
Buttons placed next to an input field should have a spacing of 8px.

### Spacing according to input fields

Input fields follow the grid both horisontally and vertically (check grid alignment). Between multiple input fields there should be a spacing of 16px, and a maximum of two fields per row.

### Spacing according to cards

Cards follow the grid both horisontally and vertically (check grid alignment). Between multiple cards there should be a spacing of at least 16px.
