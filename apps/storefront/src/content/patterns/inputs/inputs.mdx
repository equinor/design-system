**Inputs are fields or menus made to let the user write custom input, or make a selection out of predefined choices.**

## Dropdown menus

Menus displays a list of choices on temporary surfaces, and let the user select one or multiple of them. An interaction with an icon, button, or other control is needed for the menu to appear. They take up less space than selection controls, such as a set of radio buttons. They should be easily scannable, easy to interact with, and suited to the users needs.

### Multiselect dropdown menu

Watch the 2 minutes short video below about how to make a multiselect dropdown menu. All the other dropdown menus in the example image follow the same conventions, and can be easily made by adding some extra components. The selected choices could be shown with checkboxes or chips inside the field, inside the menu, or below the field.
