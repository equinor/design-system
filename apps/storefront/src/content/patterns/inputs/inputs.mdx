## Dropdown menus

Menus displays a list of choices on temporary surfaces, and let the user select one or multiple of them. The elements needed to create a menu in Figma is the `menu container` and `menu items`. An interaction with an icon, button, or other control is needed for the menu to appear. Menus should be easily scannable, easy to interact with, and suited to the users needs.
