***Charts*, also known as data visualisation, illustrate data and give insight.**


## Guidelines

Charts communicate complex information to the reader. Choosing the right type of chart is very important to how the data will be understood. Always prioritise data accuracy and helpful ways to navigate and filter the data. Aim for evenly spaced units on the graph. For example, 10, 20, 30 and not 8, 22.5, 35. 


**Don't**

* Do not have a chart without a legend. 

## How to choose the right chart

Choose the chart that most clearly presents the main insight you want to be conveyed. Make sure to take into account the audience and how they normally consume this type of data. 

(**REBECCA**, the following ### are all copy/paste from Google Material... so will need to be re-worded of course)


### Change over time

Change over time charts show data over a period of time, such as trends or comparisons across multiple categories.

1. Line charts
2. Bar charts
3. Stacked bar charts
4. Candlestick charts 
5. Area charts
6. Timelines 
7. Horizon charts
8. Waterfall charts


### Category comparison

Category comparison charts compare data between multiple distinct categories.

1. Bar charts
2. Grouped bar charts
3. Bubble charts
4. Multi-line charts
5. Parallel coordinate charts
6. Bullet charts


### Ranking 

Ranking charts show an itemâ€™s position in an ordered list.

1. Ordered bar charts
2. Ordered column charts
3. Parallel coordinate charts


### Part-to-whole

Part-to-whole charts show how partial elements add up to a total.

1. Stacked bar charts
2. Pie charts
3. Donut charts
4. Stacked area charts
5. Treemap charts
6. Sunburst charts


### Correlation

Correlation charts show correlation between two or more variables.

1. Scatter plot charts
2. Bubble charts
3. Column and line charts
4. Heatmap charts


### Distribution

Distribution charts show how often each values occur in a dataset.

1. Histogram charts
2. Box plot charts
3. Violin charts
4. Density charts



## Variations 

* *Not all currently provided in Figma*
* *Not provided in React or Vanilla* 


### Bar /column

Bar charts express larger variations of data, sometimes showing how data compares to other data from a different set. The y-axis should always start at zero to accurately represent the data.


### Line / Area

Line charts express minor variations in data over time, sometimes showing how data compares to other data from a different set. 


### Scatter plot

Scatter plot charts display complex information in a relatively uncluttered way. Scatter charts usually display one or two sets of data showing how it compares. The y-axis should always start at zero to accurately represent the data.

### Bubble 

A bubble chart is similar to a scatter plot. It contains a third data set which is represented by the size of the bubble (circle). 


### Pie / doughnut

A pie chart shows categories of data as parts of a whole. Be aware that it can be difficult to accurately distinguish the sizes of the different slices, and that a different type of chart may be better at representing the data. Make sure the sum of the slices always add up to 100%. Use seven categories or less, and arrange slices according to their size.
