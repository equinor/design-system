## Guidelines
<!--List how to use it, sizes, widths, grid interactions, color allowances -->
An `image placeholder` provides a space for the image before it is loaded, this is to avoid the page "jumping" when the image loads. It keeps the aspect ratio of the image. An aspect ratio is the proportional relationship between its width and its height. Informational photography and illustrations are used within these aspect ratios. 


## Variations 


:warning: Collapsible mega embed coming soon

<!--One ### heading per frame in Figma, explaining each component in that frame. One 'content' section per variation if needed -->


### Avatar

There are two avatar image placeholders to choose between: `Avatar/Circle` and `Avatar/Square corners`. Avatars can represent users or brands. If a user does not have an image to represent themself, the user's initials can be used on a solid background.


### Rounded corners

There are 5 `Rounded corner` aspect ratios available for use: `1:1`, `2:1`, `4:3`, `5:7`, `16:9`. 


### Straight corners

There are 5 `Straight corner` aspect ratios available for use: `1:1`, `2:1`, `4:3`, `5:7`, `16:9`.
