An image placeholder shows an image in a specific aspect ratio.

<!--One to two sentences as an introduction to the component-->

## Guidelines

<!--List how to use it, sizes, widths, grid interactions, color allowances -->

An `image placeholder` provides a space for the image before it is loaded, this is to avoid the page "jumping" when the image loads. It keeps the aspect ratio of the image. An aspect ratio is the proportional relationship between its width and its height. Informational photography and illustrations are used within these aspect ratios.

## Variations

<!--One ### heading per frame in Figma, explaining each component in that frame. One 'content' section per variation if needed -->

### Avatar

There are two avatar image placeholders to choose between: `Avatar/Circle` and `Avatar/Square corners`. Avatars can represent users or brands. If a user does not have an image to represent themself, the user's initials can be used on a solid background.
