**System icons enhance interfaces by adding visual communication to actions, status and feedback while reducing cognitive load. They are to provide meaning at a glance.**
<!--One to two sentences as an introduction to the component-->

## Guidelines
<!--List how to use it, sizes, widths, grid interactions, color allowances -->

The EDS system icons are built on a copy of the outlined [GMD icons](https://material.io/tools/icons/?style=round "Google Material Design Rounded Icons") provided open-source by Google. The icons have been customised and renamed for Equinor's use. 

Simple and clear icons require a strict underlying grid. The EDS icons are built on a 24x24px grid. System icons can be used in 16px and 24px sizes. 


**Don't**
<!--Bullet point list if needed -->

* System icons are not to be used as product icons or as a favicon. 


## Variations 


### Variation name
<!--One ### heading per frame in Figma, explaining each component in that frame. One 'content' section per variation if needed -->


There are over 600 icons available divided logical categories to make them easy to find.
