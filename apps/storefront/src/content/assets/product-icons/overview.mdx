**Product icons communicate key themes and business areas in a clear, simple and branded style. They enhance visual communication, assist with navigation and reduce cognitive load. Product icons do not provide functional interaction---use system icons instead.**

## Guidelines
<!--List how to use it, sizes, widths, grid interactions, color allowances -->

The EDS product icons are built on top of the Equinor [Brand Center](https://communicationtoolbox.equinor.com/brandcenter/en/equinorbc/component/default/103 "Brand Center Toolbox Guidelines") guidelines for iconography.

Product icons are used in app icons, app launchers and splash screens---always with the name of the product they represent. Simple and clear icons require a strict underlying grid. The EDS icons are built on a 48x48px grid. Product icons can scale up, but not down, depending on context in the grid shape.


**Don't** 
<!--Bullet point list if needed -->

* Product icons are not to be used as system icons.
* Product icons are not used for marketing or decoration.

:warning: Product icons are to be created by teams and submitted to the EDS. Over time more examples will be available.
