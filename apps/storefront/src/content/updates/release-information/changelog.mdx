## Changelog


###### All component changes in the Figma libraries will be documented in this file.


### Wednesday, 19 February 2020


**Changed**

* Updated vertical constraints on icons and avatars in the [Chips](https://eds.equinor.com/components/chips/) component from `scale` to `center` to allow reduction of the component height from 48px to 32px. 
* Moved *Listing frame* in **Navigation Drawer/Listing/Desktop** 1px to the right because the previous placement was not aligned to the grid.
