**All component changes in the Figma libraries will be documented in this file.**



### Friday, 27 March 2020


**New**

* Added new colour: `Interactive Primary/Selected Hover`.


**Changed**

* Made `Interactive/Disabled/Text` colour lighter to differentiate it from `Text + static icons/Tertiary`. This has been done to make a clearer distinction between Enabled and Disabled components.
