## What's new


### Thursday, 15 August 2019


**New**

* The design components in Figma have been released. All editors in the Equinor Figma Organization can access them. See the video below to see how to open the component library.
* This site has been updated with design documentation for each of the Figma components released. Make sure to read about the component group on the storefront before using. It is very important that we strive for consistency across the UX in the company. 
* For security, Figma SSO has been turned on. Read more about applying via AccessIT and SSO [here](https://eds.equinor.com/getting-started/designers/starting-with-figma). 
* The Slack channel [#eds-design-system](https://equinor.slack.com/messages/CJT20H1B9) is currently the best place for support and questions regarding the EDS.
* We are now focusing on the development side of the EDS. Stay tuned for more details.
