### Thursday, 5 March 2020


**Changed**

* Updated [Table Header text](https://www.figma.com/file/0bGXR2sCwMVSDNyyzu5BXrO5/UI%E2%80%94User-Interface?node-id=2450%3A1219) component to include unit, icon for sorting (users can drag & drop icons directly from assets), and applied *Auto Layout*. *Auto Layout* is a feature in Figma that adjusts the component based on the length of what the user writes. In the *Table Header text* this means that the `Label`, `Unit`, and `Icon` will resize and move as expected. The only adjustment the user has to do is adjust the width of the component. 

* Added component to [Table Cell input](https://www.figma.com/file/0bGXR2sCwMVSDNyyzu5BXrO5/UI%E2%80%94User-Interface?node-id=2450%3A2487): Table/Cell input/Active resting.

* Updated all states for [Table Cell monospaced numeric](https://www.figma.com/file/0bGXR2sCwMVSDNyyzu5BXrO5/UI%E2%80%94User-Interface?node-id=2450%3A1603) to be right aligned instead of left aligned. 


### Thursday, 27 February 2020


**New**

* As a result of numerous requests, we have added [Buttons toggle](https://www.figma.com/file/0bGXR2sCwMVSDNyyzu5BXrO5/UI%E2%80%94User-Interface?node-id=27%3A3) to Figma. EDS provides two versions, and you can choose to use either an icon and no text, or text and no icon. Read about how to use it [here](https://eds.equinor.com/components/buttons-toggle/).
* Added Ghost icon buttons for [Buttons Secondary](https://www.figma.com/file/0bGXR2sCwMVSDNyyzu5BXrO5/UI%E2%80%94User-Interface?node-id=142%3A0) and [Buttons Danger](https://www.figma.com/file/0bGXR2sCwMVSDNyyzu5BXrO5/UI%E2%80%94User-Interface?node-id=142%3A3883).
* Updated background colour in [Table Cell Active](https://www.figma.com/file/0bGXR2sCwMVSDNyyzu5BXrO5/UI%E2%80%94User-Interface?node-id=2450%3A1505) and [Table Cell Hover](https://www.figma.com/file/0bGXR2sCwMVSDNyyzu5BXrO5/UI%E2%80%94User-Interface?node-id=2450%3A1505) to be more aligned with active and hover states elsewhere in EDS components.

**New**

* The design components in Figma have been released. All editors in the Equinor Figma Organization can access them. See the video below to see how to open the component library.
* This site has been updated with design documentation for each of the Figma components released. Make sure to read about the component group on the storefront before using. It is very important that we strive for consistency across the UX in the company. 
* For security, Figma SSO has been turned on. Read more about applying via AccessIT and SSO [here](https://eds.equinor.com/getting-started/designers/starting-with-figma). 
* The Slack channel [#eds-design-system](https://equinor.slack.com/messages/CJT20H1B9) is currently the best place for support and questions regarding the EDS.
* We are now focusing on the development side of the EDS. Stay tuned for more details.
