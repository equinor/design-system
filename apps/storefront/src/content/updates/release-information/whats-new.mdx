## What's new


### Thursday, 14. August 2019


**New**

* The design components in Figma have been released. All editors in the Equinor Figma Organization can access them. 
* This site has been updated with design documentation for each of the Figma components released. Make sure to read on the Storefront about the component group before you use it. It is very important that we strive for consistency across the UX in the company. 
* The Slack channel [#eds-design-system](https://equinor.slack.com/messages/CJT20H1B9) is current the best place for support and questions regarding the EDS.
* We are now focusing on the development side of the EDS. Stay tuned for more details.
