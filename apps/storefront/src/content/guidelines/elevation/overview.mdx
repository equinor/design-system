Elevation is a visual effect that makes an element look like it's floating above the surface (using the z-axis).

<!--One to two sentences as an introduction to the component-->

## Guidelines

<!--List how to use it, sizes, widths, grid interactions, color allowances -->

The elevation effect is made using shadows to help lift an element into focus --- it is a reference to the physical world. Elements may be stacked on top of each other, but canâ€™t pass through each other.

**Don't**

<!--Bullet point list if needed -->

- Do not use elevation on icons.
- Do not use elevation on text.

## Styles

<!--One ### heading per frame in Figma, explaining each component in that frame. One 'content' section per variation if needed -->

There are six elevation effects to choose between: `None`, `Raised`, `Overlay`, `Sticky`, `Temporary nav` and `Above scrim`.
