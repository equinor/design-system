**Typography presents hierarchy and organizes information as clearly and efficiently as possible.**

## Guidelines
<!--List how to use it, sizes, widths, grid interactions, color allowances -->

The Equinor typeface is the primary typeface and is available in four weights: `light`, `regular`, `medium` and `bold` with accompanying italics. Please do not use `light` in digital interfaces except in special cases where the font size is over 48px. 


### Paragraph length

Paragraph length is the number of characters in a line of text --- this includes spaces. 
To ensure readability, line length should be between 55-80 characters. Lines less than 55 characters can cause strain on the eye requiring the eye to jump to the next line too quickly, breaking the reading rhythm. Lines greater than 80 characters can make it difficult for users to continue on the correct line in a large body of text.



## Styles 

Too many type sizes can cause confusion. The EDS has a limited set of type sizes that work well with together.

### Headings


There are seven headings to choose between: `H1 bold`, `H1`, `H2`, `H3`, `H4`, `H5`, `H6`.


### Paragraph

There are many paragraph styles to choose between: `Overline`, `Ingress`, `Body long`, `Body long link`, `Body long italic`, `Body long bold`, `Body long bold italic`, `Body short`, `Body short link`, `Body short italic`, `Body short bold`, `Body short bold italic` and `Caption`.

The style `Body short` is used for short paragraphs, with less than four lines, that sit on their own. It is most commonly used within components.


### Additional styles

There are other typography styles that are used internally within components.
