**Every part of your interface should be intentional---this includes spacing. While spacing is invisible, it gives air and readability to your interface. Our spacing scale is based on 8px increments.**

## Guidelines
<!--List how to use it, sizes, widths, grid interactions, color allowances -->


Spacing is used to apply margin and padding across all platforms. 
The EDS has a predefined set of spacers. These predefined sizes will ensure consistency across interfaces.  
The spacers **XX Small** and **X Small** are only to be used inside of components. 
While the spacers **Small** up to **XXX Large** can be used within components as well as between components.

- Always make sure to follow the [accessibility guidelines](link) by having 8px of spacing between each clickbound. 


## Spacing hierarchy

Too much information without spacing can be overwhelming on the user. Sufficient spacing helps the user process information and rest the eyes.

* Less spacing between elements imply they relate to eachother
* More spacing between elements imply they do not relate to eachother
* Sufficient spacing around elements helps user process the information
* Generally, more spacing around an element makes it seem more important


## Variations
