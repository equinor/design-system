**Every part of your interface should be intentional---this includes spacing. While spacing is invisible, it gives air and readability to your interface. Our spacing scale is based on 8px increments.**

## Guidelines
<!--List how to use it, sizes, widths, grid interactions, color allowances -->


Spacing is used to apply margin and padding across all platforms. 
The EDS has a predefined set of spacers. These predefined sizes will ensure consistency across interfaces.  
The spacers `XX Small` and `X Small` are only to be used inside of components, while the spacers `Small` up to `XXX Large` can be used both within and between components.

- Always make sure to follow the [accessibility guidelines](https://eds.equinor.com/guidelines/accessibility/) by having 8px of spacing between each clickbound. 


## Spacing hierarchy

Too much information without spacing can be overwhelm the user. Sufficient spacing helps the user process information and rest the eyes.

* Less spacing between elements imply they relate to each other.
* More spacing between elements imply they do not relate to each other.
* Sufficient spacing around elements helps users process the information.
* Generally, more spacing around an element makes it seem more important.


## Variations 
<!--One ### heading per frame in Figma, explaining each component in that frame. One 'content' section per variation if needed -->


### Vertical spacing


There are eight spacers to choose between: `XX Small`, `X Small`, `Small`, `Medium`, `Large`, `X Large`, `XX Large` and `XXX Large`. The spacers `XX Small` and `X Small` are only to be used inside components, while the other spacers are to used in layouts.

### Horizontal spacing


There are eight spacers to choose between: `XX Small`, `X Small`, `Small`, `Medium`, `Large`, `X Large`, `XX Large` and `XXX Large`. The spacers `XX Small` and `X Small` are only to be used inside components, while the other spacers are to be used in layouts.
