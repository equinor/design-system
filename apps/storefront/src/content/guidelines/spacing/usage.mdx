## Figma


### How to add

1. Locate the **Assets** tab in the **Layers Panel**.
2. There are two ways to locate the `Spacing` component needed: 
	* Use the search bar to search for a component grouping name or variation name.
	* Scroll through the folders list and open the relevant grouping.
3. Once the component needed is located, click and drag it into the frame/artboard. 


### How to use

1. Select the `Spacing` in the frame/artboard. 
2. Resize the component by dragging the component from one end while _not_ holding shift. 
    * `Horizontal` components will only be resizable horizontally and `Vertical` components will only be resizable vertically.
