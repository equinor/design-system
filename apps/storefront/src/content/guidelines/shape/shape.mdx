**Components can have many different shapes---establishing a common shape keeps consistency**
<!--One to two sentences as an introduction to the component-->

***

## Guidelines
<!--List how to use it, sizes, widths, grid interactions, color allowances -->

To reflect the round corners of the Equinor logo, our shapes have a default rounded corner of 4px. You will notice this in the corners of buttons, cards, menus and more.



## Variations 


### Variation name
<!--One ### heading per frame in Figma, explaining each component in that frame. One 'content' section per variation if needed -->

There are six different shapes to choose between when you are building a component: **Button**, **Icon button**, **Corners**, **Straight**, **Field** and **Circle**.
