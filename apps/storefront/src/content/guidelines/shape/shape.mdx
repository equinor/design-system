Components can have many different shapes---establishing a common shape keeps consistency.

<!--One to two sentences as an introduction to the component-->

## Guidelines

<!--List how to use it, sizes, widths, grid interactions, color allowances -->

To reflect the round corners of the Equinor logo, our shapes have a default rounded corner of 4px. You will notice this in the corners of buttons, cards, menus and more.

## Variations

### Variation name

<!--One ### heading per frame in Figma, explaining each component in that frame. One 'content' section per variation if needed -->

There are many different shapes to choose between when you are building a component, such as: `Button`, `Icon button`, `Corners`, `Straight`, `Field` and `Circle`.
