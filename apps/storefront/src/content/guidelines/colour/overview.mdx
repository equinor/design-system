**The EDS's look and feel is light and airy. Colour helps show hierarchy, champion the Equinor brand and indicate interactivity.**

## Guidelines
<!--List how to use it, sizes, widths, grid interactions, color allowances -->

Use the colours provided in the EDS. These are the brand colours and have been tested to make sure that, provided you follow the guidelines stated below, they will either meet or exceed the accessibility guidelines.

Tip:  
_Many people have trouble differentiating certain colours, so make sure colour is not the only way to convey certain information._



**Don't**
<!--Bullet point list if needed -->
* Do not add your own colours.

### Interactive colours


Moss Green is dedicated to be the **Interactive Primary** colour for internal digital interfaces and experiences. 
This is different from other branding you might see in print and marketing. The decision was made to guarantee that there is no confusion with errors. 

Slate Blue is dedicated to be the **Interactive Secondary** colour. 

Energy Red is strategically not used since it is easy to misunderstand as an error or alert colour.


#### Feedback colours

Interactive feedback colours for **Danger** (red), **Warning** (orange) and **Success** (green) are also available for use.

#### Text colours

As you build your interfaces, you will only need to use the **Primary** text colour which is used for **Headings** and for **Body** text. 
The **Secondary** and **Tertiary** text colours are nested into components that are already assembled.


#### UI background colours

You can choose between **Default** (which is white) or **Light** and **Medium** greys for the background of your interface. 
The other four **UI Backgrounds** are nested into components that are already assembled for you.  

Please do not add your own background colours---the default theme is light and airy and does not allow for dark mode at this time.


### Infographic colours 

There are two sets of infographic colours for you to choose between: **Infographic Primary** and **Infographic Substitute**. 


#### Primary infographic colours 

Aim to avoid creating multi-coloured charts and diagrams. Monochrome charts and diagrams are preferred wherever possible. Please take care when using reds with blue and green colours to avoid making the red data points appear as a warning or negative data. 


#### Substitute infographic colours

The **Infographic Substitute** colours have been developed for enhanced legibility. First use all the reds, then use all the greens before finally adding in all the blues. 
These colours are restricted for exceptional circumstances and only when the **Infographic Primary** colours do not offer enough clarity and definition. 


### Exceptions for interactive and infographic colours

If you need to use additional colours for domain-specific requirements, charts or graphs---make sure to test your colours for contrast. 
This is strictly for domain-specific cases and does not give approval for choosing new colours based on personal preferences. 
Use high contrast colours, as this both increases general readability and includes the needs of users with impaired vision.
