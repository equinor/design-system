A _slider_ is a flexible input that allowss users to adjust predefined values.

<!--One to two sentences as an introduction to the component-->

## Guidelines

<!--List how to use it, sizes, widths, grid interactions, color allowances -->

Sliders reflect values along a bar where users can select a single value or a range of values. Sliders reflect the current state of the values they control, and value changes are immediate to the content in which they belong.

### Labels

Number and abbreviation labels are allowed. They should clearly communicate the values such as: Min., Max, Avg. or a number.

**Don't**

<!--Bullet point list if needed -->

- Do not use a slider without a title indicating what the slider controls.
- Do not use for ranges that are extremely different, e.g., 1-10000.
- Do not use for ranges that are very small, e.g., 1-4.
