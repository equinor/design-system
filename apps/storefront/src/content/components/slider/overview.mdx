<!--One to two sentences as an introduction to the component-->

## Guidelines
<!--List how to use it, sizes, widths, grid interactions, color allowances -->

Sliders reflect values along a bar where users can select a single value or a range of values. Sliders reflect the current state of the values they control, and value changes are immediate to the content in which they belong. 


### Labels

Number and abbreviation labels are allowed. They should clearly communicate the values such as: Min., Max, Avg. or a number. 

**Don't**
<!--Bullet point list if needed -->

* Do not use a slider without a title indicating what the slider controls. 
* Do not use for ranges that are extremely different, e.g., 1-10000.
* Do not use for ranges that are very small, e.g., 1-4.
