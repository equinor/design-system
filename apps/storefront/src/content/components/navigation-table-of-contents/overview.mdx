**A *table of contents* is a list of hyperlinks that scroll to anchored text on the same page.**
<!--One to two sentences as an introduction to the component-->

## Guidelines
<!--List how to use it, sizes, widths, grid interactions, color allowances -->

Table of contents, also known as *anchors* or *article navigation*, link to anchored sections on a page.  They always link to the current page. Table of contents can be placed either under the main heading and scroll away with the page, or to the right of the page's main content and be sticky. 


### Labels

* Avoid labels that are too long. 
* Labels should be to the point and short, no more than three words. 
* If the label does not fit in the space provided, truncation is allowed and should have a tooltip provided.
* The label should reflect the section heading it links to.


**Don't**
<!--Bullet point list if needed -->

* Do not use table of contents to link to other pages. 
* Do not use labels like "Click here" or "Jump to".
