## Figma

### How to add

1. Locate the [Assets tab :warning:]() in the **Layers Panel**.
2. There are two ways to locate the `Card` component needed. 
	* Use the search bar to search for a component grouping name or variation name.
	* Scroll through the folders list and open the grouping needed.
3. Once the component is located, click and drag it into the frame/artboard. 
4. Cards are like legos, add as many of the card components needed.


### How to use

1. Place the `card/container` as the bottom layer of your card. 
2. Toggle the grid layout on/off by using the following shortcut:
  * Mac: `Control` + `G`
  * PC: `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `4`
3. Align the card to fit within the grid applied to your frame/artboard. 
4. Stack additional `Card` components above the `card/container`, making sure to follow the grid within the `card/container`. 
  * `Rich media/Leading image` is always full bleed/full width and ignores the card's innner grid. 
  * All `Title` and `Action` blocks are only to be resized in width, not height. 
5. Select all the `Card` layers and group them together, always naming the group layer.
