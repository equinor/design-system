**A *card* displays content related to a single subject and acts as an entry point to more detailed information. Card blocks can be combined in a variety of ways.**


***


## Guidelines

Cards should display data related to a single topic. They are easy to scan and have clear actions. Cards can be customized by combining different *card* blocks. Dividers can be used to seperate sections within a card, however, the divider should not be full-width/full-bleed. 


**Don't**
* Do not use cards as or in _Top bars_
* Do not use cards as _Sidesheets_
* Do not use cards as or in _Nav drawers_
* Do not use cards as _Lists_
* Do not use cards inside other cards
* Do not use cards as galleries
* Do not use cards with text over photography or illustrations 
* Do not use cards to group large sets of information 


## Variations

### Card container

The `container` is the only required block in a card. The card aligns to the artboard/frames grid columns, which gives the card a fluid width. Content blocks within the card, however, follow the card container's own grid. There are four availible `card/container` options: `default`, `info`, `danger` and `warning`. The primary action of a card is generally the card itself being a large touch target.

### Supporting text

There are two supporting text blocks to choose between: `supporting-text/middle` which is to be used when it is sandwiched between other blocks, and `supporting-text/last` which is to be used when it is the last block. 


#### Content

Supporting text blocks can have: 
* Supporting text
  * Should not contain multiple paragraphs
  * Use inline links with high caution

### Rich media

There are three rich media blocks to choose between: `rich-media/middle` which is to be used when it is sandwiched between other blocks, `rich-media/last` which is to be used when it is the last block and `rich-media/leading-image` which is to be used when it is the first block. The `rich-media/middle` and `rich-media/last` blocks are placeholder blocks, meaning that you can add your own rich content to them. 


#### Content

Rich media blocks can have: 
* Graph
* Table
* Image
  * within the grid when between blocks and full width when leading
* Dividers

### Supplemental actions

There are three supplemental action blocks to choose between: `supplemental-actions/buttons`, `supplemental-actions/icons` and `supplemental-actions/meta`. Supplemental actions are represented by buttons, icons, UI controls and supporting text. A rule of thumb is to place them at the bottom of a card. 


#### Content

Supplemental action blocks can have: 
* Supplemental actions
* Dividers
  * Content that can be expanded should use full-width dividers, ignoring the horizontal spacing.
* Overflow menu
* UI controls
* Chips
