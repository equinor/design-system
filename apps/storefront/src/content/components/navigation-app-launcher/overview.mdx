An _app launcher_ provides navigation for applications related to the application the user is currently viewing.

<!--One to two sentences as an introduction to the component-->

## Guidelines

<!--List how to use it, sizes, widths, grid interactions, color allowances -->

An app launcher is used to organise navigation across different applications related or relevant to the current application. The current application shows as _active_ in the app launcher. Each application displayed has a `Product icon` as well as a label that gives clear and concise direction. Note that if the label is longer than the maximum width, it will be truncated and should have a tooltip provided.

**Don't**

<!--Bullet point list if needed -->

- Do not use `System icons` in the app launchers.
- Do not scroll within the app launcher.
- Do not place the app launcher outside of the viewport.
- Do not list more than three _app buttons_ across the app launcher.
- Do not change the width of the _listing_.
- Do not shrink text size to fit a label on a single line.
- Do not wrap a label over two lines.

## Variations

<!--One ### heading per frame in Figma, explaining each component in that frame. One 'content' section per variation if needed -->
