**An *app launcher* provides navigation for applications related to the application the user is currently viewing.**
<!--One to two sentences as an introduction to the component-->

## Guidelines
<!--List how to use it, sizes, widths, grid interactions, color allowances -->

An app launcher is used to organise navigation across different applications related or relevant to the current application. The current application shows as *active* in the app launcher. Each application displayed has a `Product icon` as well as a label that gives clear and concise direction. Note that if the label is longer than the maximum width, it will be truncated and should have a tooltip provided.


**Don't** 
<!--Bullet point list if needed -->


* Do not use `System icons` in the app launchers.
* Do not scroll within the app launcher. 
* Do not place the app launcher outside of the viewport. 
* Do not list more than three *app buttons* across the app launcher. 
* Do not change the width of the *listing*.
* Do not shrink text size to fit a label on a single line.
* Do not wrap a label over two lines.
