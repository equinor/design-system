title: `Navigation: app launcher`

**An *app launchers* provides navigation for applications related to the application the users is currently viewing.**
<!--One to two sentences as an introduction to the component-->

***

## Guidelines
<!--List how to use it, sizes, widths, grid interactions, color allowances -->

An app launcher is used to organize navigation across different applications related or relevant to the current application. The current application shows as *active* in the app launcher. Each application displayed has a `Product icon` as well as a label that gives clear and concise direction. Note that if the label is longer than the maximum width, it will be truncated and should have a tooltip provided.


**Don't** 
<!--Bullet point list if needed -->


* Do not use `System icons in the app launchers
* Do not scroll within the app launcher. 
* Do not place the app launcher outside of the viewport. 
* Do not list more than 3 *app buttons* across the app launcher. 
* Do not change the width of the *listing*.
* Do not shrink text size to fit a label on a single line.
* Do not wrap a label over two lines.
