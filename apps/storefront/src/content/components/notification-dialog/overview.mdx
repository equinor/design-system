***Dialogs* display critical notifications and required actions.**

## Guidelines
<!--List how to use it, sizes, widths, grid interactions, color allowances -->

A dialog is a modal window that appears over everything on the screen and always over a *Scrim*. Dialogs can appear without warning and require users to stop their current task so they should be used sparingly. The dialog disables all application functionality and requires an action to be taken in order to be dismissed. 

In the notification family, dialogs are the most interruptive. *Banners* deliver medium priority slightly interruptive notifications, *Snackbars* deliver low priority un-interruptive notifications. Since dialogs are very disruptive, they should be used only in critical situations. 


**Don't** 
<!--Bullet point list if needed -->

* Do not use a dialog if a Snackbar or Banner would work better. 
* Do not use a dialog without a Scrim behind it. 
* Do not allow a dialog to be dismissed by clicking on the Scrim. 
* Do no scroll away a dialog. 


## Variations 
<!--One ### heading per frame in Figma, explaining each component in that frame. One 'content' section per variation if needed -->

Dialogs can contain a Title, Content and Actions. A dialog can have one or two actions, but never a third. Actions should always be related to the message. Dialogs should try to avoid scrollable content. When scrolling is necessary, the title and actions are fixed and the content scrolls. There are five dialog variations available for use: `Text + actions`, `Placeholder + actions`, `Placeholder`, `Scrollable placeholder + actions` and `No title + text + actions`.
