	* Scroll through the folders list and open the grouping needed.
3. Once the component is located, click and drag it into the frame/artboard. 


### How to use

1. Place the `Dialog` at the top of your frame/artboard. 
2. Locate the **Design** tab in the **Inspector Panel**.
4. Edit the content sections: 
    * Title: Tripple-click on the title to edit.
    * Text: Tripple-click on the text to edit. 
    * Placeholder content: Build your own components to swap the nested `Placeholder` instance with if needed. 
    * Actions: Place and align `Buttons` in the action area then turn off the action placeholder. 
5. Make sure to turn off any `Placeholder` *layers* that are not used.
