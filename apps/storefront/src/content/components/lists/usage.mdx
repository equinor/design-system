## Figma

### How to add

1. Select the text in the frame/artboard. 
2. For bullet lists, manually add a `•`, `∙`, or `◦` before each line. 
  * Figma does not support indenting, so each indented level needs four `spaces` added before it. 
3. For numbered lists, manually add the numbers `1.`, `2.` and so on, before each line. 
  * Figma does not support indenting, so each indented level needs four `spaces` added before it.
