**Pagination allows long sets of data or content to be divided into multiple pages with controls to navigate between these pages.**
<!--One to two sentences as an introduction to the component-->

## Guidelines
<!--List how to use it, sizes, widths, grid interactions, color allowances -->
When content will take a long time to load or is better viewed in smaller sets, pagination can be used to divide this content into multiple pages. Pagination only loads one page at a time. 


**Don't** 
<!--Bullet point list if needed -->
* Do not lazy load content as the user scrolls when using pagination. 


## Variations 
<!--One ### heading per frame in Figma, explaining each component in that frame. One 'content' section per variation if needed -->

There are three variations of *pagination* to use: `Page numbers`, `Total + page numbers`, `Switcher + total + page numbers`.

## Interaction

The active page number always stays in the middle, shifting the previous numbers. For example, in pagination with five page buttons but ten pages---pages 1, 2, 9, and 10 will not be able to be centered when they are active, but the rest will be.
