Title should be like this: 
title: Navigation: Pagination


**Pagination allows long sets of data or content to be divided into multiple pages with controls to navigate between these pages.**
<!--One to two sentences as an introduction to the component-->

***

## Guidelines
<!--List how to use it, sizes, widths, grid interactions, color allowances -->
When content will take a long time to load or is better viewed in smaller sets, pagination can be used to divide this content into multiple pages. Pagination only loads one page at a time. Depending the page the default number of items displayed can change. 


**Don't** 
<!--Bullet point list if needed -->
* Do not user to lazy load content as the users scrolls. 


## Variations 
<!--One ### heading per frame in Figma, explaining each component in that frame. One 'content' section per variation if needed -->

There are three variations of *pagination* to use: `Page numbers`, `Total + page numbers`, `Switcher + total + page numbers`.
