### How to add

1. Locate the **Assets** tab in the **Layers Panel**.
2. There are two ways to locate the `Navigation: Pagination` component needed. 
	* Using the search bar, searching for a component grouping name or variation name.
	* Scrolling through the folders list, opening the grouping needed.
3. Once the component needed is located, click and drag it into the frame/artboard. 


### How to use

1. Select the `Pagination` in the frame/artboard. 
2. Locate and expand the highlighted *layer* in the **Layers Panel**.
3. If using `Total + page numbers` or the `Switcher + total + page numbers` edit the text.
4. Never add height to *pagination*, only resize horizontally in width.
