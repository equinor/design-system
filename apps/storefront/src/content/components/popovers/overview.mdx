**A *popover* is a floating card that provides more information or actions on hover or click.**

## Guidelines
<!--List how to use it, sizes, widths, grid interactions, color allowances -->

A popover provides excess or additional information that did not fit in the main content area. A popover always has an indicator (caret) towards the area it is attached to. Popovers should never be wider than 560px and their height should not be taller than 80% of the screen. 

To dismiss a popover, use the close icon, press the `ESC` key, open another popover or click outside the popover. If there are no actions in the popover, then the close icon should be the first focusable element. 


**Don't**
<!--Bullet point list if needed -->

* Do not use for a single short line of text, use a  *Tooltip* instead. 
* Do not have multiple popovers open at the same time.
