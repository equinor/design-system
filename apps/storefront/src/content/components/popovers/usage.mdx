### How to add

2. There are two ways to locate the `Popover` component needed: 
	* Use the search bar to search for a component grouping name or variation name.
  * Scroll through the folders list and open the relevant grouping.
3. Once the component needed is located, click and drag it into the frame/artboard. 


### How to use

1. Select the `Popover` in the frame/artboard. 
2. Locate and expand the highlighted *layer* in the **Layers Panel**.
3. Toggle off the visibility of the `Caret` *layers* that are not needed.
4. If using text, toggle off the placeholder and edit the text. If the text wraps over one line, add 16px in height per line of text added to the whole component.
5. If using the placeholder, toggle off the text and replace the placeholder with your custom content.
