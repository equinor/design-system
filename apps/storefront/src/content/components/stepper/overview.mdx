***Steppers* guide users through the steps of a task.**
<!--One to two sentences as an introduction to the component-->

***

## Guidelines
<!--List how to use it, sizes, widths, grid interactions, colour allowances -->

When a task is more advanced or complicated, visual help from a stepper lets the user know where they are in the current process. 


**Don't** 
<!--Bullet point list if needed -->

* Do not use with less than 3 steps. 


## Content

* Avoid titles that are too long. Titles should be to the point and short, no more than three words if possible.
* Keep the item labels as short as possible.
* Use meaningful item labels that explain the function.
* Item labels should be in the active tense.
* Do not mix nouns and verbs. Pick one or the other.
* Always use icons that clearly communicate their intended purpose.


## Variations 
<!--One ### heading per frame in Figma, explaining each component in that frame. One 'content' section per variation if needed -->
