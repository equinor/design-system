## Figma

### How to add

1. Locate the **Assets** tab in the **Layers Panel**.
2. There are two ways to locate the `Toggle button` component needed:
   - Use the search bar to search for a component grouping name or variation name.
   - Scroll through the folders list and open the grouping.
3. Once the component needed is located, click and drag it into the frame/artboard.
4. Add as many toggle buttons as needed by snapping them together. At least one `Toggle button left` and one `Toggle button right` is required.

### How to use

1. Select the `Toggle button` in the frame/artboard.
2. Locate and expand the highlighted _layer_ in the **Layers Panel**.
3. Edit the text. If the text wraps over one line, resize the width of the button to avoid line breaks.
4. If using the `Toggle button icon`, change the icon:
   - Locate and select the `Icon > Placeholder Icon` _layer_ in the **Layers Panel**.
   - Locate the **Design** tab in the **Inspector Panel**.
   - Under the **Instance** section, click the icon name to expand the menu.
   - Choose a new icon.
5. Never add height to _toggle buttons_, only resize them horizontally in width.
6. Add as many toggle buttons as needed, and repeat steps 1â€“4. You will need at least one `Toggle button left` and one `Toggle button right`.
7. Select all the `Toggle button` layers and convert them to a frame/artboard by using the following shortcut:
   - Mac: `Command` + `Option` + `G`
   - PC: `Ctrl` + `ALT` + `G`
8. Make sure to name the new group.
9. Locate the **Design** tab in the **Inspector Panel**.
10. Under the **Constraints** section, set up constraints.
