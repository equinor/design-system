## Guidelines
<!--List how to use it, sizes, widths, grid interactions, color allowances -->

A *navigation drawer* is used to hold navigation with multiple groupings or many levels. Use a *navigation drawer* when the content will have more sections than would comfortably fit in the `Top bar` as *tabs*. A *navigation drawer* can only have on grouping. When using `Grandparent` and `Parent` grouping items, always use `System icon/Arrows/chevron ...` to indicate nested items. A `Child` can be used with and without a `Parent` and can be used with only a `Grandparent`. Always make sure to use the `Active` state for the active page. 

A *navigation drawer* can be persistent or toggled via the navigation icon in the *Top bar*. Below `Xpx`the *navigation drawer* tranforms into a collapsed drawer or becomes a toggled hidden drawer. Hidden navigation drawers are accessible via the navigation icon in the `Top bar`.  


**Don't** 
<!--Bullet point list if needed -->
* Do not change the height of the individual items. 


## Variations 
<!--One ### heading per frame in Figma, explaning each componnet in that frame. One 'content' section per variation if needed -->
