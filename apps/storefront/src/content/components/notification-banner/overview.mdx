_Banners_ display important notifications and related optional actions.

<!--One to two sentences as an introduction to the component-->

## Guidelines

<!--List how to use it, sizes, widths, grid interactions, color allowances -->

Notification banners should communicate a change or error. Banners are always at the top of the page but below the _Top bar_. Banners require an action in order to be dismissed. Banners deliver medium priority information---while _Snackbars_ deliver low priority and _Dialogs_ delivery high priority information. Banners are meant to be slightly interruptive but not overly distracting. Banners can be fixed or scroll away with content.

Banners are also known as _Top bar_ or _Alerts_.

**Don't**

<!--Bullet point list if needed -->

- Do not put a banner above the top bar.
- Do not use more than one banner at a time.
- Do not include links in the text.

## Variations

<!--One ### heading per frame in Figma, explaining each component in that frame. One 'content' section per variation if needed -->

The `Text` or `Text + icon` with the optional `Actions` combined are to fill 100% of the width of the main content area. They are not to go over open _Navigation drawers_ or fixed _sidesheets_ but beside them.

### Text

Banners should have a single message with specific actions (optional) related to that message. Banner messages should be written as full sentences with punctuation.

### Text + icon

To help weight the banner more on the screen a supporting icon can be added. Choose an icon from the `System Icons` that helps strengthen your message.

### Actions

Actions are optional. Actions should always be related to the message. Banners can have up to two actions. Action labels should be short and text only.

If the screen is not wide enough, place the actions below the message on their own line. (In Figma, remember to turn off the `Text` layers bottom border.)
