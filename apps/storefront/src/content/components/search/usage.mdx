## Figma

### How to add

1. Locate the **Assets** tab in the **Layers Panel**.
2. There are two ways to locate the `Search` components needed. 
	* Using the search bar, searching for a component grouping name or variation name.
	* Scrolling through the folders list, opening the grouping needed.
3. Once the component needed is located, click and drag it into the frame/artboard. 


### How to use

1. Place the `Search field` needed on the frame/artboard. 
2. If needed, place the `Search Scope` needed on the frame/artboard. Make sure to leave **2px** between the *field* and the *scrope*. 
3. Edit the text. Do not change the icons. 
4. Never add height, only resize horizontally in width. 
5. Select all the `Search` *layers* and *group* them together, always naming the grouped layer.
