## Figma

### How to add

1. Locate the **Assets** tab in the **Layers Panel**.
2. There are two ways to locate the `Search` components needed:
	* Use the search bar to search for a component grouping name or variation name.
	* Scroll through the folders list and open the relevant grouping.
3. Once the component needed is located, click and drag it into the frame/artboard. 


### How to use

1. Place the `Search field` needed on the frame/artboard. 
2. If needed, place the `Search Scope` on the frame/artboard. 
  * Make sure to leave **2px** between the *field* and the *scope*. 
  * If using a `Menu` that supports typing, keep the *cursor* layer visible, otherwise hide the layer. 
  * Hide the *hover hand* or *hover cursor* layer based on your needs. 
3. Edit the text. Do not change the icons. 
4. Never add height, only resize horizontally in width. 
5. Select all the `Search` *layers* and *group* them together, always naming the grouped layer.
