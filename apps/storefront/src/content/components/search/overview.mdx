## Guidelines
<!--List how to use it, sizes, widths, grid interactions, color allowances -->

Users can type a term, press `Enter` to see the results.  Auto-complete, recent searches, suggested searches and pre/post scoping are available via the *Menu* component. 


### Global Search

Global search can be used a a primary way of discovering content. The global search placeholder text should always say "Search". The global search should be replace the *Center custom content, placeholder* of the `Top bar`. The global search can be a button icon that is expanded into the `Search field` if search is less common in the application. 


### In-context Search

In-context search allows users to search within a section of content---such as a table. The placeholder text should give users a hint at what type of results they can expect.  


## Variations 
<!--One ### heading per frame in Figma, explaining each component in that frame. One 'content' section per variation if needed -->
