Users can type a term, press `Enter` to see the results.  Auto-complete, recent searches, suggested searches and pre/post scoping are available via the `Menu` component. 


### Global Search

Global search can be used a a primary way of discovering content. The global search placeholder text should always say "Search". The global search should be replace the *Center custom content, placeholder* of the `Top bar`. The search field is recommended, but not required, to be 400px wide. The global search can be a button icon that is expanded into the `Search field` if search is less common in the application. 


### In-context Search

In-context search allows users to search within a section of content---such as a table. The placeholder text should give users a hint at what type of results they can expect. The search field is recommended, but not required, to be 400px wide.
