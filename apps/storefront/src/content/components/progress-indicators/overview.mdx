***Progress indicators* are animated helpers that indicate waiting time as content loads.**
<!--One to two sentences as an introduction to the component-->

## Guidelines
<!--List how to use it, sizes, widths, grid interactions, color allowances -->

Progress indicators inform users about the current loading state, giving them insight into the process. Progress indicators may be determinate or indeterminate. 

### Determinate

Determinate progress indicators indicate how long the process will take. They should be used once there is an estimate of wait time available. 


### Indeterminate

Indeterminate progress indicators indicate an unknown amount of time the process will take. They should be used when there is *not* an estimated wait time available. 


## Variations 
<!--One ### heading per frame in Figma, explaining each component in that frame. One 'content' section per variation if needed -->


### Linear

Linear progress indicators are great to focus attention to an area. They are great for places like empty pages, at the bottom of the topbar and in cards and in lists.
