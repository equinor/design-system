**A scrim is a temporary visual effect that fades the general interface while allowing the user to focus on an overlay.**

***

## Guidelines

Always use a scrim with an overlay component such as a dialog, elevated sidesheet or elevated navigation drawer (mobile only).

## Interactions

When the scrim is clicked on or the `Esc** key is pressed---the overlay component will close, closing the scrim with it.
