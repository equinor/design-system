### How to add

1. Locate the **Assets** tab in the **Layers Panel**.
2. There are two ways to locate the `Navigation: Breadcrumbs` components needed: 
	* Use the search bar to search for a component grouping name or variation name.
	* Scroll through the folders list and open the relevant grouping.
3. Once the component needed is located, click and drag it into the frame/artboard. 


### How to use

1. Place the `Navigation: Breadcrumbs` needed on the frame/artboard. 
2. Select a `Navigation: Breadcrumbs` in the frame/artboard. 
3. Locate and expand the highlighted *layer* in the **Layers Panel**.
4. Edit the text. If the text wraps over one line, resize the width of the `Navigation: Breadcrumbs` to avoid line breaks.
5. Never add height to `Navigation: Breadcrumbs`, only resize them horizontally in width. 
6. Repeat steps 2-5 until each breadcrumb has the correct label. 
7. Align all the `Navigation: Breadcrumbs`to be side-by-side, bottom aligned making sure each breadcrumb touches the next. 
8. Select all the `Navigation: Breadcrumbs` *layers* and *group* them together, always naming the grouped layer.
