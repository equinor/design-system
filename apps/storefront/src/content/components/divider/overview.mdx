**A divider is a thin line that seperates content into clear groups.**

## Guidelines
<!--List how to use it, sizes, widths, grid interactions, color allowances -->
Dividers are not meant to scream, they are subtle ways to group sections. Dividers can only be used in the colors `UI Background/Default`, `UI Background/Light` and `UI Background/Medium`. Dividers can be used Full-width/Full-bleed or attached to columns width. 


**Don't** 
<!--Bullet point list if needed -->
* Do not use colors that are not approved for dividers. 
* Do not change the thickness of the divider.
* Do not change the style of the divider. 


## Variations 
<!--One ### heading per frame in Figma, explaining each component in that frame. One 'content' section per variation if needed -->

There are two divider variations available for use---`Divider/Small` and `Divider/Medium`. The divider line is the same in both of these, yet, the spacing around the divider is different.
