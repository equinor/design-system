**A divider is a thin line that seperates content into clear groups.**
<!--One to two sentences as an introduction to the component-->

## Guidelines
<!--List how to use it, sizes, widths, grid interactions, color allowances -->
Dividers are not meant to scream, they are subtle ways to group sections. Dividers can be used in the colors `UI Background/Default`, `UI Background/Light` and `UI Background/Medium`. Dividers can be used Full-width/Full-bleed or attached to columns. 


**Don't** 
<!--Bullet point list if needed -->
* Do not use colors that are not approved for dividers. 
* Do not change the thickness of the divider.
* Do not change the style of the divider. 


## Variations 
<!--One ### heading per frame in Figma, explaning each componnet in that frame. One 'content' section per variation if needed -->

There are two divider variations avaliable for use---`Divider/Small` and `Divider/Medium`. The divider line is the same in both of these, however, the spacing around the divider is different.
