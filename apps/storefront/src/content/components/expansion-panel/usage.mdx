### How to add

1. Locate the **Assets** tab in the **Layers Panel**.
2. There are two ways to locate the `Accordion` component needed. 
	* Use the search bar to search for a component grouping name or variation name.
	* Scroll through the folders list and open the grouping needed.
3. Once the component is located, click and drag it into the frame/artboard. 


### How to use

1. Place the `Accordion` on your frame/artboard.  
2. Locate the **Design** tab in the **Inspector Panel**.
3. Rename the label. 
4. Resize the accordion to the width needed. 
5. Resize the accordion to the height needed: 
    * If the accordion is closed, then the height is 48px. 
    * If the accordion is open, then the minimum height is 96px.
6. Change the action icon: 
    * Locate and select the `Icon > Nested icon > Placeholder Icon` or `Icon > Nested icon > Cheveron down` *layer* in the **Layers Panel**.
    * Locate the **Design** tab in the **Inspector Panel**.
    * Under the **Instance** section, click the icon name to expand the menu. 
    * Choose a new icon. 
7. For expanded accordions, build your own components to swap the nested `Placeholder` instance with if needed.
