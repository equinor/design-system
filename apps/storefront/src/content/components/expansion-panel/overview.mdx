**An *accordion* allows users to collapse and expand sections of content.**
<!--One to two sentences as an introduction to the component-->

***

## Guidelines
<!--List how to use it, sizes, widths, grid interactions, colour allowances -->

Accordions are composed of a header area and a content area. They delivery large amounts of information in user controlled sections. They can be used to group or hide information helping to keep order and scanability on a page. 



**Don't** 
<!--Bullet point list if needed -->

* Do not use if there is not enough content. Accordions increase cognitive load, do not use if grouping small amounts of content. 
* Do not change the width of the accordion when it is expanded or collapsed. 



## Variations 
<!--One ### heading per frame in Figma, explaining each component in that frame. One 'content' section per variation if needed -->

### Header area

When the accordion is expanded or collapsed, the header height must be 48px. The header area must contain one action indicating that the section expands or collapses and can contain additional actions. The expand/collapse functionality is tied to the entire header. Additional actions are triggered only by interacting directly with that action. 


### Content area

When the accordion is expanded, the minimum height for the content area is 96px. There is no maximum height for the content area.


## Interaction

* Multiple sections can be expanded simultaneously.
