Title should be like this: 
title: Navigation: Tabs


**Tabs organize related content across different views to be quickly navigated.**
<!--One to two sentences as an introduction to the component-->

***

## Guidelines
<!--List how to use it, sizes, widths, grid interactions, color allowances -->
Tabs allow for navigation between content that is related and has equal hierarchy. Each tabs content should be noticeably different from the other. Tabs allow for information to be presented in a space saving layout. 


**Don't**
<!--Bullet point list if needed -->

* Do not use tabs to scroll down through long pages on sequential content. 
* Do not stretch a tab to be wider than XXpx. 
* Do not wrap or stack tabs. 
* Do not change the height of the tabs. 
* Do not use less than two tabs. 
* Do not use tabs over imagery. 


## Variations 

:warning: Collapsible mega embed coming soon


<!--One ### heading per frame in Figma, explaining each component in that frame. One 'content' section per variation if needed -->
### Width

Tabs have a minimum width - which is 16px of spacing on each side of the label. 

### Fixed width

### Horizontal scrolling tabs

Tabs that are wider than the space available are always swappable/scrollable having a next and previous icon button for navigation. 

### Content


#### Labels

Note that if the label is longer than the maximum width, it will be truncated and should have a tooltip provided.


#### Number of tabs

#### Tab order




## Exceptions

If the `Navigation: Navigation Drawer ` is not used, tabs may be used in the `Navigation: Top Bar` as a main navigation linking to unrelated pages.
