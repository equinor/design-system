## Figma


### How to add

1. Locate the **Assets** tab in the **Layers Panel**.
2. There are two ways to locate the `Snackbar` component needed. 
	* Using the search bar, searching for a component grouping name or variation name.
	* Scrolling through the folders list, opening the grouping needed.
3. Once the component needed is located, click and drag it into the frame/artboard. 


### How to use

1. Select the `Snackbar` in the frame/artboard. 
2. Locate and expand the highlighted *layer* in the **Layers Panel**.
3. Edit the text. If the text wraps over one line, resize the width of the button to avoid line breaks.
4. Never add height to Snackbars, only resize them horizontally in width.
5. Edit the action text.
