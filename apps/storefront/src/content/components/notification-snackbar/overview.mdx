***Snackbars* provide brief temporary non-interrupting notifications at the bottom of the screen.**

## Guidelines
<!--List how to use it, sizes, widths, grid interactions, color allowances -->

Snackbars provide an update on a process that has or will be performed. Snackbars deliver low priority information---while *Banners* deliver medium priority and *Dialogs* deliver high priority information.  Snackbars appear centered at the bottom of the screen and disappear without user interaction. On wider screens they are left-aligned. Snackbars appear on-screen between 5-10 seconds before dismissing themselves, so keep text short. 

Snackbars can have one action. This action should not be "Close " or "Dismiss" since snackbars disappear automatically. Actions such as "Undo" or "Retry" are acceptable. Snackbars can wrap up to two lines of text on smaller screens. 


**Don't**
<!--Bullet point list if needed -->

* Do not stack snackbars. 
* Do not show more than one snackbar at a time. 
* Do not add links to the text. 
* Do not add more than one action. 
* Do not add icons to snackbars. 
* Do not hide core functionality or navigation in snackbar actions.
