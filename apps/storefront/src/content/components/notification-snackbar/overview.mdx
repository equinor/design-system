## Guidelines
<!--List how to use it, sizes, widths, grid interactions, color allowances -->

Snackbars provide update on a process that has or will be preformed. Snackbars delivery low priority information---while Banners delivery medium priority and Dialogs delivery high priority information.  Snackbars appear centered at the bottom of the screen and disappear without user interaction. On wider screens, they are left aligned. Snackbars appear on screen between 5-10 seconds before dismissing themselves, so keep text short. 

Snackbars can have one action. This action should not be "Close " or "Dismiss" since snackbars disappear automatically. Actions such as "Undo" or "Retry" are acceptable. Snackbars can wrap up to two lines of text on smaller screens, 


**Don't**
