Buttons allow users to take action with a single click or tap.

## Guidelines

The EDS has primary, secondary and danger colour buttons available in the contained, outlined and ghost variations. All variations can have the following: an icon on the right, an icon on the left, an icon with no text and text only with no icon. When using an icon, it must be directly related to the action and label of the button.

### Button vs link

A button is used when performing an action. Actions are almost always on the same page. A link is used when navigating to another place.

### Button width

Buttons have a minimum padding that is automatically built into the component. You can however stretch the button to span one or multiple columns in width.

### Button labels

Avoid labels that are too long. Titles should be to the point and short, no more than three words. Don´t wrap text over multiple lines, scale the width to make the text fit on one line. Don´t adjust the height of the button.

### Buttons with a left or right icon

Buttons can use an icon to help clarify an action. Always use icons that clearly communicate their intended purpose.

## Variations
