## Figma


### How to add

1. Locate the **Assets** tab in the **Layers Panel**.
2. There are two ways to locate the `Button` component needed: 
   	* Use the search bar to search for a component grouping name or variation name.
  	* Scroll through the folders list and open the grouping.
3. Once the component needed is located, click and drag it into the frame/artboard. 


### How to use

1. Select the `Button` in the frame/artboard. 
2. Locate and expand the highlighted *layer* in the **Layers Panel**.
3. Edit the text. If the text wraps over one line, resize the width of the button to avoid line breaks.
4. Never add height to *buttons*, only resize them horizontally in width. 
5. For *Buttons* that contain a nested icon: 
    * Locate and select the `Icon > Nested icon > Placeholder Icon` *layer* in the **Layers Panel**.
    * Locate the **Design** tab in the **Inspector Panel**.
    * Under the **Instance** section, click the icon name to expand the menu. 
    * Choose a new icon.
