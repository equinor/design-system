### How to add

1. Locate the [Assets tab :warning:]() in the **Layers Panel**.
2. There are two ways to locate the `Button` component needed. 
	* Using the search bar, searching for a component grouping name or variation name.
	* Scrolling through the folders list, opening the grouping needed.
3. Once the component needed is located, click and drag it into the frame/artboard. 


### How to use

1. Select the `Button` in the frame/artboard. 
2. Locate and expand the highlighted layer in the *Layers Panel*.
3. Edit the text. If the text wraps over one line, resize the width of the button to avoid line breaks.
4. Never add height to buttons, only resize them horizontally in width. 
5. For `Buttons` that contain a nested icon: 
  * Locate and select the `Icon > Nested icon > Placeholder Icon` layer in the **Layers Panel**.
  * Locate the [Design tab :warning:]() in the **Inspector Panel**.
  * Under the **Instance** section, click the icon name to expand the menu. 
  * Choose a new icon.
