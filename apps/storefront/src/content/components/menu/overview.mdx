**A *menu*, also known as a *dropdown*, is a temporary list of actions or functions**
<!--One to two sentences as an introduction to the component-->

***

## Guidelines
<!--List how to use it, sizes, widths, grid interactions, color allowances -->
A *menu* should always be triggered from a *button*, use the `Ghost icon` or `Right icon` button. A menu can be dismissed by pressing `Escape` on the keyboard, clicking outside the menu or by selecting an action or function in the menu. Full-bleed/full-width dividers are allowed to group content. Menus can be combined to create cascading *menus* allowing users to choose from a large variety of choices. These are organised by displaying menus with multiple levels of hierarchy. Cascading menus appear to the right of the parent and only on the left if there is no room for expansion on the right. 


**Don't**
<!--Bullet point list if needed -->
* Do not trigger a menu on hover. 
* Do not use a menu with a scrim.


## Variations 
<!--One ### heading per frame in Figma, explaining each component in that frame. One 'content' section per variation if needed -->

There are three item types available to place in the `Container`---`Subtitle`, `Item` and `Leading + item`. 

* Item labels are mandatory. 
* The right aligned command and icon is optional. 
* The left aligned icon is mandatory to use in a menu grouping on at least one item. 


#### Content

* Keep the item labels as short as possible. 
* Use meaningful item labels that explain the function.
* Item labels should be in the active tense. 
* Do not mix nouns and verbs. Pick one or the other.
