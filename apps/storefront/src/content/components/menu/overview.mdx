**A *menu*, also known as a *dropdown*, is a temporary list of actions or functions**
<!--One to two sentences as an introduction to the component-->

***

## Guidelines
<!--List how to use it, sizes, widths, grid interactions, color allowances -->
A *menu* should always be triggered from a *button*. Use the `Ghost icon` or `Right icon` *button*. A *menu* can be dismissed by pressing `Escape` on the keyboard, clicking outside the menu or by selecting an action or function in the *menu*. Full-bleed/full-width dividers are allowed to group content. *Menus* can be combined to create cascading *menus* allowing users to choose from a large variety of choices. These are orgnised by displaying *menus* with multiple levels of hierarchy. Cascading *menus* appear to the right of the parent and only on the left if there is no room for expansion on the right. 




**Don't**
<!--Bullet point list if needed -->
* Do not trigger a *menu* on hover. 
* Do not mix nouns and verbs. Pick one or the other. 
* Do not use a *menu* with a *scrim*.


## Variations 
<!--One ### heading per frame in Figma, explaning each componnet in that frame. One 'content' section per variation if needed -->

There are two item types avaliable to place in the `Container`---`Item` and `Leading + icon`. 

* Item labels are mandatory. 
* The right aligned command and icon are optional. 
* The left aligned icon is mandatory to use in the menu grouping on at least one item. 



#### Content

* Keep the item labels as short as possible. 
* Use meaningful item labels that explain the destination.
* Item labels should be in the active tense.
