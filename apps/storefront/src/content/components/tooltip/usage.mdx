How to add
Select "Assets" (link to glossary) and find the tooltip element by either scrolling to the "Tooltips" section or search for "tooltip".  Add the tooltip by dragging it to your project.

How to use
When adding a fresh tooltip element, all of its pointers/carets will be visible. Please refer to the "Tooltip" page (link to page) under "Components" for guidelines on how to configure tooltips. As you will only need one caret, please hide the carets you don't need by going to Layers and then the relevant layer for the tooltip and then toggle the eyeball (link to glossary) with each element you don't want.
