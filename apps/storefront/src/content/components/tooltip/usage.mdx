### How to add

1. Locate the [Assets tab :warning:]() in the *Layers Panel*.
2. There are two ways to locate the `Tooltip` component needed. 
	* Using the search bar, searching for a component grouping name or variation name.
	* Scrolling through the folders list, opening the grouping needed.
3. Once the component needed is located, click and drag it into the frame/artboard. 


### How to use

1. Select the `Tooltip` in the frame/artboard. 
2. Locate and expand the highlighted layer in the *Layers Panel*.
3. [Toggle off :warning:]() the visibility of the `Caret` layers that are not needed.
4. Edit the text. If the text wraps over one line, add 16px in height per line of text added to the whole component.
