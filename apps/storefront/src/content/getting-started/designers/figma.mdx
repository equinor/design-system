## What is Figma

Figma is a collaborative interface design tool for UI design and prototyping. It increases efficiency with the added flexibility of team libraries (the EDS) with components, styles and fonts automatically distributed.

**Platform agnostic**  
Figma is browser-based. It can also be downloaded as a stand-alone application for MacOS, Windows, Chromebook and Linux.

**Real-time collaboration**  
Edit along with your team and see what they are doing in real-time.

**Communication**  
Leave contextual feedback by commenting directly in the design file.

**Prototyping**  
Quickly create and share your prototype with others for review or testing.

**Development**  
Your development team will always have view access to the current files and prototypes.


## Applying to use Figma

Continue using the same tools and processes as you have been. 
Still eager to prepare? Familiarise yourself with Figma - this will be your tool for designing and prototyping within the EDS. 
The Figma Organization licences will be available to use with the EDS once it is ready - more information on this will come later.

## Working in Figma


### Finding components

* In the left sidebar, choose the tab **Assets**
    * :warning: Image example like: https://i.imgur.com/cyt9T1Q.png
* You can then scroll through the list to find the component, or you can use the search box. 
* Click and drag the component out to the frame you need it on.
* Do not change the colours or layouts. 


### Swapping instaces

### Grids

* Change your nudge amount to 8px
    * :warning: Information coming soon on how to
* Make sure to read the Grid guidelines before working with the EDS (:warning: link to grids)


### Clickbounds are hidden by default

When starting to use Figma, you might wonder why some components, such as buttons, have a larger bounding box than visual presence. This is due to a layer called the clickbound, which is 48px in height. This is in accordance with the WCAG guidelines for touch targets (which is 44px ---and rounded up 4px to sit nicely on the 8-grid).


### Placeholders 

When builing layouts, you can add a placeholder where you donâ€™t have content ready. Placeholders are also built into many EDS components. 

When a nested component is ready, simply replace the placeholder by dragging the component over the placeholder while holding down the shortcut described below.

- Mac: Ctrl + Apple key
- PC: Ctrl + Alt
