## What is Figma

Figma is a collaborative interface design tool for UI design and prototyping. It increases efficiency with the added flexibility of team libraries (the EDS) with components, styles and fonts automatically distributed.

**Platform agnostic**  
Figma is browser-based. It can also be downloaded as a stand-alone application for MacOS, Windows, Chromebook and Linux.

**Real-time collaboration**  
Edit along with your team and see what they are doing in real-time.

**Communication**  
Leave contextual feedback by commenting directly in the design file.

**Prototyping**  
Quickly create and share your prototype with others for review or testing.

**Development**  
Your development team will always have view access to the current files and prototypes.


## Applying to use Figma

* Go to [AccessIT](https://accessit.equinor.com), search and apply for Figma access.
* It will say there is a yearly cost, this cost is only activated if you are given editor access from your Figam team admin. 
* If it asks for a reason when you are applying, write in the comment that you are a designer or developer working on 'project name'.
* It will be approved but it might take some time until you get the acceptance email.
* When you get that email saying it was approved read through all the instructions. 
* Log into Figma with your Equinor email (you will have to make an account). You will have to use the SAML SSO (single sign on with your Authenticator code).
* Have your team admin add you to your team or search for the team you wish to join and request access.

## Working in Figma


### Finding components

* In the left sidebar, choose the tab **Assets**
    * Image example like: https://i.imgur.com/cyt9T1Q.png
* You can then scroll through the list to find the component, or you can use the search box. 
* Click and drag the component out to the frame you need it on.
* Do not change the colours or layouts. 


### Component updates

Example: https://i.imgur.com/CZYkIWQ.png

From time to time, components will be updated in the EDS library---these can be reviewed, then accepted or denied. If accepted, all instances of the updated component(s) will be updated. This will not change the content that you have overridden, like custom colors or text. If denied, you will be asked again the next time you load the file. Read more about it on [Figma.com Accepting updates from your team library](https://help.figma.com/article/314-accepting-updates-from-your-team-library)


### Grids

* Change your nudge amount to 8px, learn how [here](https://spectrum.chat/figma/help/how-do-i-change-my-nudge-values~f946ed5b-4c6d-42d7-9475-470a4b52639d)
* Make sure to read the Grid guidelines before working with the EDS 


### Clickbounds are hidden by default

When starting to use Figma, you might wonder why some components, such as buttons, have a larger bounding box than visual presence. This is due to a layer called the clickbound, which is 48px in height. This is in accordance with the WCAG guidelines for touch targets (which is 44px ---and rounded up 4px to sit nicely on the 8-grid).


### Placeholders 

When builing layouts, you can add a placeholder where you donâ€™t have content ready. Placeholders are also built into many EDS components. 

When a nested component is ready, simply replace the placeholder by dragging the component over the placeholder while holding down the shortcut described below.

- Mac: Ctrl + Apple key
- PC: Ctrl + Alt
