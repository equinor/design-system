## Working in Figma


### Finding components

* In the left sidebar, choose the tab **Assets**
    * Image example like: https://i.imgur.com/cyt9T1Q.png
* You can then scroll through the list to find the component, or you can use the search box. 
* Click and drag the component out to the frame you need it on.
* Do not change the colours or layouts. 


### Component updates

From time to time, components will be updated in the EDS library---these can be reviewed, then accepted or denied. If accepted, all instances of the updated component(s) will be updated. This will not change the content that you have overridden, like custom colors or text. If denied, you will be asked again the next time you load the file. Read more about it on [Figma.com Accepting updates from your team library](https://help.figma.com/article/314-accepting-updates-from-your-team-library)


### Grids

* Change your nudge amount to 8px, learn how [here](https://spectrum.chat/figma/help/how-do-i-change-my-nudge-values~f946ed5b-4c6d-42d7-9475-470a4b52639d)
* Make sure to read the Grid guidelines before working with the EDS 


### Clickbounds are hidden by default

When starting to use Figma, you might wonder why some components, such as buttons, have a larger bounding box than visual presence. This is due to a layer called the clickbound, which is 48px in height. This is in accordance with the WCAG guidelines for touch targets (which is 44px ---and rounded up 4px to sit nicely on the 8-grid).


### Placeholders 

When builing layouts, you can add a placeholder where you donâ€™t have content ready. Placeholders are also built into many EDS components. 

When a nested component is ready, simply replace the placeholder by dragging the component over the placeholder while holding down the shortcut described below.

- Mac: Ctrl + Apple key
- PC: Ctrl + Alt
