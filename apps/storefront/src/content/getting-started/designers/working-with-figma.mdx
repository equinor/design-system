## Working with Figma


### Setting up your project

There is not limit to the amount of projects a team can have---this is great, because your team can then stay very organised. Each file created, inside a project, must contain a cover page. A cover page sits on the first page of every file, the page name should be "Cover". Place the `Default File Cover` on the page and file in the information. This allows others now or much later down the road to know who is responsible for this file and who to ask if they have questions. Change the status badge as the file progresses, remembering to change the background color of the cover page to match the current badge color.

### Grids

* Change your nudge amount to 8px, learn how [here](https://spectrum.chat/figma/help/how-do-i-change-my-nudge-values~f946ed5b-4c6d-42d7-9475-470a4b52639d "Figma Spectrum Chat"). 
* Make sure to read the Grid guidelines before working with the EDS. 
* Always place everything on an artboard/frame. 


### Finding components

* In the left sidebar, choose the tab **Assets**
    * Image example like: https://i.imgur.com/cyt9T1Q.png
* You can then scroll through the list to find the component, or you can use the search box. 
* Click and drag the component out to the frame you need it on.
* Do not change the colours or layouts. 


### Component updates

From time to time, components will be updated in the EDS library---these can be reviewed, then accepted or denied. If accepted, all instances of the updated component(s) will be updated. This will not change the content that you have overridden, like custom colors or text. If denied, you will be asked again the next time you load the file. Read more about it on [Figma.com: Accepting updates from your team library](https://help.figma.com/article/314-accepting-updates-from-your-team-library)


### Clickbounds are hidden by default

When starting to use Figma, you might wonder why some components, such as buttons, have a larger bounding box than visual presence. This is due to a layer called the clickbound, which is 48px in height. This is in accordance with the WCAG guidelines for touch targets.


### Placeholders 

When building layouts, you can add a placeholder where you donâ€™t have content ready. Placeholders are also built into many EDS components. 

When a nested component is ready, simply replace the placeholder by dragging the component over the placeholder while holding down the shortcut described below.

- Mac: Ctrl + Apple key
- PC: Ctrl + Alt
