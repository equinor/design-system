## Applying to use Figma

* Go to [AccessIT](https://accessit.equinor.com "AccessIT"), search and apply for Figma access.
* A yearly cost is shown, but this cost is only activated if you are given *editor* access from your Figma team *admin*. 
* If it asks for a reason when you are applying, write in the comment that you are a designer or developer working on "project name".
* It will be approved but it might take some time until you get the acceptance email.
* When you get the email saying it was approved, read through all the instructions. 
* Go to Figma and select **Log in**. Then select **Log in with SAML SSO**, enter your Equinor email and **Log in**.
* You will have two tabs in your Figma account. The way to know the tabs apart is the Equinor will say **Equinor** with the logo, while your personal tab will have your name and initials.
  * The first tab is your Equinor area, which is for projects shared with everyone. One thing to note, is that you can not transfer projects or files from your personal area to the Equinor area. If your account is deactivated, all your Equinor tab drafts will be transferred to the Equinor Figma *admins*---so this area should only be used for work files.
  * The second tab is your personal area, which is 100% your area to play around in Figma for free and test things out in private.  
* Have your team *admin* or *owner* add you to your team OR search for the team you wish to join and request access. 
  * You will be added as a *viewer* by default. If you plan to edit, ask your team *admin* or *owner* to upgrade you. 
  * *Viewers* can: 
    * View and comment on files and projects in which they have access. 
    * View a list of *all* teams in the Equinor Figma Organisation.
    * Access the EDS components, styles and fonts.  
  * *Editors* can do everything a *viewer* can, plus they can create and edit files. 

## Setting up a team in Figma

Search first to make sure the team doesn't already exist. Projects should not be mixed, so make a team per project. There is no limit in Figma to the amount of teams created---however, there is no need for duplicates. To create a team, click the **Create New Team** button that is at the end of the teams lists pop-up. Give the team an appropriate name, knowing that anyone in Figma can see the name. You will also need to choose **Access within the organisation**. 


### Access types

> #### Open teams

> **Visibility**: Everyone within your organisation can see the *open* team listed, join it, and see all of the projects or documents inside.

> **Permissions**: Members who choose to join an open team will be given view access (with the ability to comment, inspect and export assets) by default so they can't accidentally edit something. Team *admins* can grant edit access to the team to individual people as necessary.

> **Good for**: Companies that want to foster a highly collaborative environment. When people have a window into what other teams are working on, they have the opportunity to work more cross-functionally and they can maintain consistent patterns across different products or projects.


> #### Closed teams

> **Visibility**: Everyone in the organisation can see that the *closed* team exists from the **View all teams** modal, but non-members will not be able to immediately see or join the projects and documents inside.

> **Permissions**: Users who wish to join a closed team need to request access to see projects. Team *admins* can permit or deny these requests and give the users the appropriate amount of access (view or edit).

> **Good for**: This type will be best suited for teams who can't share their work with the entire organisation, but can still benefit from everyone knowing about their existence. This gives people a destination to go if they do require access.


> #### Secret teams

> **Visibility**: No one can see that a *secret* team exists within the Figma Organisation, unless they are the creator or have been specifically invited to join.

> **Permissions**: *Owners* of secret teams need to individually invite the members they want to have access. They can also set the appropriate view or edit permissions for each user.

> **Good for**: This is great for top secret projects that only a very specific subset of users require access to. Think of work done leading up to an acquisition or something that cannot have org-wide knowledge. This access type can be changed at any point to give these teams more visibility when the timing is right.

### Responsibilities


By default in Figma, there is a project folder called **Design System** in each new team created. Please delete this whole folder, it is not the EDS and can cause confusion. 


#### Members

Members are any users that have been added to the Equinor Figma Organisation---their email needs to be an Equinor email. 

Members are able to: 

* View and comment on files and projects in which they have access. 
* View a list of *all* teams in the Equinor Figma Organisation.
* Access the EDS components, styles and fonts.  


#### Member management

* By default, members added to your team will be added as a *viewer*.
* It is the *owners'* choice to upgrade the *viewer* to *editor* or *admin*. If you are unable to upgrade a *viewer* to and *editor*, reach out to the EDS team on Slack. 
* Users are currently able to upgrade themselves to an *editor* by transferring a file into the team from their drafts. However, this can be blocked on a user-by-user basis by the *admins* of the Equinor Figma Organisation. 
* As the team *owner*, it is your responsibility to make sure that *only* those who need it are *editors*. *Owners*, *admins* and *editors* incur a monthly cost to Equinor---however, *viewers* do not. You are able to upgrade someone to an *editor* and downgrade them within the same billing cycle. 
  * If an *editor* is on an extended leave, change their account to *viewer* and upgrade them when they return. 
  * If a team member is no longer part of the team, remove them from the team.
