## Applying to use Figma

* Go to [AccessIT](https://accessit.equinor.com), search and apply for Figma access.
* It will say there is a yearly cost, this cost is only activated if you are given editor access from your Figam team admin. 
* If it asks for a reason when you are applying, write in the comment that you are a designer or developer working on 'project name'.
* It will be approved but it might take some time until you get the acceptance email.
* When you get that email saying it was approved read through all the instructions. 
* Log into Figma with your Equinor email (you will have to make an account). You will have to use the SAML SSO (single sign on with your Authenticator code).
* Have your team admin add you to your team or search for the team you wish to join and request access.
