The Equinor design system (EDS) is Equinor's official design system. It provides a collection of guidelines and reusable components that can be assembled in different combinations to design and build digital interfaces.
All design and code components are high-quality, production-grade and accessibility-tested.
This allows Equinor to manage design at scale by creating a single source of truth for teams to design, prototype and develop.

## Goals

**People first**  
The EDS creates a visual UI language that is based on standard UI patterns for real people.

**Efficient**  
It's a reliable, working system that allows teams to focus their time on creating great experiences and solving complex logic.

**Collaborative**  
The EDS is open for all teams working with design and development at Equinor. Everyone is encouraged to contribute.

## Principles

**Flexible**  
Built to be flexible. Its components are designed to work smoothly with each other.

**Accessible**  
It's designed and developed to be accessible to everyone---regardless of their ability or situation.

**Meaningful motion**  
Motion is used to focus attention and is not decorative.

**Cross-platform**  
Maintains the same UI across platforms---using shared components, tokens and guidelines.
