EDS is already a huge success on the design side, and has become the de facto UX design tool in Equinor. In order for the EDS React component library to be equally successful – we need as many developers as possible to contribute. 

There are many ways to contribute – it could be in the form of code reviews on pull requests, or maybe you’ve seen a component or have made one yourself that you think will be valuable for others, or maybe you want to implement a React component – all contributions are valuable.

## Code reviews

We have pull requests for every component we’re working on, also work in progress. If you have an opinion on something, please comment in the pull request or do a complete code review. 


## Implement a component

There are Github issues for every design component in Figma. If you see one that you can help us with, reach out to us on [Slack](//app.slack.com/client/T02JL00JU/CJT20H1B9) and we’ll help you getting started. 

## Feature requests

Are there components we’ve made that’s missing features? Do you have an idea for a component that should be in the component library? If so, please [create an issue](//github.com/equinor/design-system/issues/new?template=feature_request.md) using the «feature requests» template. 


## Testing and bug hunting

All the components have unit tests – but there’s always the chance of the odd bug passing under the radar. If you find one, please [create an issue](//github.com/equinor/design-system/issues/new?template=bug_report.md) using the «bug report» template.
