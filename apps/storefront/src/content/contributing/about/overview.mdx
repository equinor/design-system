## Overview

The EDS's overarching goal of creating consistent interfaces, experiences and being platform agnostic. The system serves the people using it - the designers and developers. They are the real customers and are always to be at the center of the work when contributing to the design system. If we were not to have them in mind, we would do them a disservice to their users. 

Building such a system is no easy task. There are components to research, design, test, develop, pressure test, document, bugs to fix, questions to answer and maintenance to be done---to name a few things. 



## Roles and responsibilities

### Users

*Users* are employees at Equinor who will use the interfaces and solutions that are build on the EDS. 


### Customers

*Customers* are the designers, developers, documenters and project managers that are building interfaces and solutions with the EDS. They have a responsibility to report bugs.


### Contributors

*Contributors* are *customers* who are dedicating time back to build the EDS. These are people who are working for or contracted to Equinor. *Contributors* contribute by doing research, designing new components, testing, developing, maintaining, pressure testing, documenting, fixing bugs, reporting bugs, and supporting *users*.

*Contributors* are expected to deliver quality. The EDS serves the whole of Equinor---there is a high standard that must be met before any work is published. New components may trigger additional requirements that must be considered. Such as: are all states and behaviours available for use, has the new component passed all accessibility testing, have all considerations been taken for how this component will respond on different viewports and is good documentation written for both designers and developers?
