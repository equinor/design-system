## The EDS partnership programme

The EDS is for your team to use - and hopefully has alleviated stress and helped your team to delver faster. Teams using the EDS  EDS are suggested to contribute 5% of their time back to the EDS. Depending on your team size, that could mean one person contributing a few hours a week or a day a month. This is not something unique to the EDS -- others companies like [AirBnB](https://airbnb.design/systems-thinking-unlocked/) and [WordPress](https://ma.tt/2014/09/five-for-the-future/) have programmes like this.

The 5% contribution can be in design, development, maintenance, security, documentation, testing, training or other things that come up over time that are needed to keep the system alive and well. Five precent is not mandatory, 5% is not the minimum or maximum you can contribute either. It is a suggestion to help keep the system you are relying on alive. Those using the system daily are the ones that will know it best inside and out---it is fitting that they will be the ones to help nurture it and keep it healthy.
