## The EDS partnership programme

The EDS is for your team to use---hopefully it alleviates stress and helps your team deliver faster. Teams using the EDS are suggested to contribute five per cent of their time back to the EDS. Depending on your team size, this could mean one person contributing a few hours a week or one day a month. This is not something unique to the EDS---other companies like [AirBnB](https://airbnb.design/systems-thinking-unlocked/) and [WordPress](https://ma.tt/2014/09/five-for-the-future/) have programmes like this.

The five per cent contribution can be in design, development, maintenance, security, documentation, testing, training or other things that arise over time and are needed to keep the system alive and well. Five per cent is not mandatory, nor is it the minimum or maximum you can contribute either. It is a suggestion to help keep the system you are relying on alive. Since those using the system daily are the ones that know it best, it is fitting that they will be the ones to help nurture and keep it healthy.
