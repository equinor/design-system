## Figma setup 

* Make sure to download the stand-alone app, it will help you to work more efficiently. 
* Make sure in Figma, under Preferences that "Snap to geometry/object/grid" are all on. 
* In Figma, under Preferences - set your "Nudge amount" to 8px. 


## Building components

* Always start to make every component in a frame/artboard. 
* Component grids use a custom colour of #000FF at 25% for lines, and 10% for columns/rows. This allows the users of the EDS to see the default red grids apart from component girds. 
* When making a new component, use the `.Token Header` and `.Token Row`. Place each variation of the component on a `.Token Row`. Make each `.Token Row` tall enough to fit the component in between the guide. If the component is light, toggle on the dark background *layer*. 
* The name in the link/table row should be the page name + frame name + component name
* The component name is always without the page or frame name. 
* Make sure the section is grouped together on a frame and that all the components are the top layers. Extend the frame height when adding a new components. 
* Make sure to test an instance of the component you have made or changed. Test its responsiveness and test it with new content. 
* Always remember to **PUBLISH** your changes, adding commit notes.
