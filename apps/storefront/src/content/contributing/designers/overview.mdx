The EDS is first and foremost design driven. 


We are always looking for people who can expand upon the patterns and visuals that have already been created. 


We are making the building blocks, which deve will dev, that all projects will be build upon. 

Making consisten patterns that will ease congintive load for users is essential. 
Creatign components that are ok to look at for long periods of time and do not cause strain on the eyyes is of the upmost importance. 

We need designers to help that can see the big picture. You are not creating a component for your project or for your taste. You are createing components that will be used by 100's of designers adn developers around Equinor. These commponents need to work for a wide range of applications. Additionally, we need you to be able to explain the rules/doucumentation around said component. Explaining how it might interact with other components, expections to the rules that are see as well as the pracical side of how to use it in Figma. 

You will also need to work closely with the developers who are taking these components from Figma and transforming them into code components. 

Changing components that have already been created is also a possability. This needs to be taken very serisouly as one small change in the Assets, Tokens or UI will ripple through all projects. Each file will be given a warning---so make sure to push/publish changes in batches, as not to worry or overwhelm the deisgn teams. Constant changes can cause doubt or worry within teams as well, so setting an established time for publishing changes is something we strive for. Not only will the changes ripple through teams, but the changes of previou compoenents also need to be considered against how that component interacts with other components.
