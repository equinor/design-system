## How we write

Refering to UI in Figma, use **bold**. 
  * **Layers Panel*, **Inspector Panel**, **Style Library**
  
When refering to a invidivual layer in Figma, use *italics*
  * *Layer* or *Group*

When refering to an frame in Figma, always use "frame/artboard" to make sure all users understand since both terms are common. 

When refering to a item being full-width, always use "full-width/full-bleed" to make sure all users understand since both terms are common. 

When refering to a component use, `code` blocks.
  * `Interactive Primary`, `rich-media/last`, `Logo`

When refering to keyboard shortcuts, use `code` blocks.
  * `ESC`, `A`, `Control`

When refering to a component group name, use *italics*.
  * *Buttons*, *Top bar*, *Lists*.

We do not use the term "you". 
  * Your is allowed if there is no way around it. 
  * Exception: In the contribution section, we speak more directly to the cusomter.
