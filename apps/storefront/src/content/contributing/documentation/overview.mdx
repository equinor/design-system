**One of the many ways you can contribute to the EDS is by writing, editing or approving documentation. Solid documentation ensures that trust is built and confusion is avoided.**


## Component page structure

Each component page has an *overview* and *usage* tab. 


### Overview tab

When starting a new page, copy the `overview-template.mdx` contents. This template serves as a starting point for the documentation. There must be an ingress and guidelines, however, the rest of the template is only needed if there is content to fill it. 


### Usage tab

The usage tab is divided into two main sections: *Figma* and *code*. These sections are to help customers when they are familiarising themselves with a new component. The usage guide should be organised by steps, kept to the point and only include necessary information.
