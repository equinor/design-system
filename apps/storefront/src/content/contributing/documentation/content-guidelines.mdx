## Language

The language of the EDS is British English. While component names in both Figma and code are written in American English, the documentation is written in British English. Clear, accurate and concise language allows for a better user-experience of the EDS. If a statement can be made simpler, do it. The EDS documentation is not a place for fancy words or complex sentences. The EDS will be read by many who's first language is not English. 



## Guidelines for writing content

All EDS documentation is written in Markdown. 

Referring to UI in Figma, use `**bold**`. 
  * **Layers Panel**, **Inspector Panel**, **Style Library**
  
When referring to an individual layer in Figma, use `*italics*`.
  * *Layer* or *Group*

When referring to a frame in Figma, always use "frame/artboard" to make sure all users understand, since both terms are common. 

When referring to an item being full-width, always use "full-width/full-bleed" to make sure all users understand, since both terms are common. 

When referring to a component use, ``code`` blocks.
  * `Interactive Primary`, `rich-media/last`, `Logo`

When referring to keyboard shortcuts, use ``code`` blocks.
  * `ESC`, `A`, `Control`

When referring to a component group name, use `*italics*` the first time the grouping is referenced. Following references, on the same page, do not need special formatting. 
  * *Buttons*, *Top bar*, *Lists*.

We do not use the term "you". 
  * Your is allowed if there is no way around it. 
  * Exception: In the contribution section, we speak more directly to the customer.
