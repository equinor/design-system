# Tone prompts

As discussed in the [tone and style](tone-and-style.md) documentation, the two official styles for the EDS documentation are:

1. The friendly-professional tone and
2. The minimalist tone.

In this documentation, we will define the official prompts used in document generation for each
tone and for both tones combined, giving us a total of three distinct prompts which can be applied.

# Friendly Professional

# Prompt

Rewrite/ write the (following) content in a Friendly Professional style.
Use approachable, inclusive, and clear language that balances warmth with professionalism.
Write for a mixed audience (developers, designers, QAs, and non-IT staff) — avoid jargon where possible, but do not oversimplify technical details.
Always use the active voice and direct phrasing.
Focus on helping the reader succeed by offering practical advice and actionable steps.
Use short to medium length sentences (avoid long, complex structures).
Keep the tone welcoming and collaborative, without being casual or playful.
Avoid slang, sarcasm, or heavy humour.
Ensure consistency, readability, and accessibility for all users.
Always follow Oxford English spelling (e.g., organise, recognise, analyse).
Only use lists or bullet points when the content is naturally a list(e.g., steps, rules, dos/don'ts).

# Writing Rules
