# Documentation Tone and Style

Our documentation should sound consistent, clear and approachable. To achieve this, we've agreed on two official styles: Sprout-inspired and Minimalist. 
These styles will be used as the foundation for all documentation.


# 1. Friendly-Professional Style

Inspired by the sprout documentation style, the friendly-professional tone is warm, friendly, and encouraging. 
It focuses on building trust and fostering a sense of community. This style uses approachable language, 
positive messaging, and creative energy to guide users through the documentation. 
The goal is to make readers feel supported and inspired, while clearly connecting information to the brand’s values and purpose.

It's tone is:

Friendly and welcoming: The writing is approachable and encourages creativity and collaboration.

Clear and concise: Information is presented in short, direct sentences with minimal jargon.

Purpose-driven: The documentation often references values, brand purpose, and the importance of consistency.

Inspirational: Phrases like “inspire meaningful customer experiences” and “designed with care” are used to motivate and connect with the reader.

Trust-building: The tone emphasizes reliability, care, and long-term value.

Inclusive: The language is inclusive, using “we” and “our” to foster a sense of community.

Overall, the tone reflects a positive, supportive, and brand-focused voice, 
aiming to guide and empower users while reinforcing Sprout’s values and identity.



# 2. Minimalist Style

The minimalist tone is direct, neutral, and efficient. It prioritizes clarity and simplicity, presenting information in a 
straightforward manner without unnecessary embellishments. This style uses concise language, clean structure, 
and a calm voice to help users quickly find what they need. 
The aim is to reduce distractions and make the documentation as accessible and usable as possible.

It's tone is:

Direct and succinct: Information is presented in the fewest words possible, 
avoiding unnecessary details or embellishments by using bullet points or short sentences.

Neutral and objective: The writing avoids emotional language, focusing on facts and clarity.

Uncluttered structure: Content is organized with clear headings, short paragraphs, and ample whitespace.

Functional: Instructions and explanations are practical, with a focus on usability and efficiency.

Consistent: Terminology and formatting are uniform throughout, reducing cognitive load.

Calm and understated: The tone is quiet, confident, and avoids hype or persuasive language.

Accessible: Language is simple, avoiding jargon and complex sentence structures.

Overall, minimalist documentation prioritizes clarity, ease of use, and a clean reading experience,
helping users find what they need quickly without distraction.
