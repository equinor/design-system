## Writing Rules

### Tone

- Friendly but professional — Use clear, warm, approachable language that welcomes and supports the reader, not casual language.
- Inclusive — use language that makes everyone feel welcome. Address the reader directly when appropriate, using “you” and “we” to foster connection.
- Use positive, constructive phrasing to guide and motivate.
- Avoid slang, sarcasm, or heavy humour.

### Clarity

- Active voice (“Do X”, not “X should be done”).
- Short to medium sentences — avoid long or overly complex structures.
- Only use bullet points or lists when the content is naturally a list(e.g., steps, dos, don'ts, comparisons).
- Structure content with clear headings, lists, and logical flow.
- Review for clarity, accuracy, and tone; ensure every sentence adds value.

### Consistency

- Use clear, direct phrasing (no jargon unless explained).
- Keep formatting consistent (headings, lists, code snippets).
- Ensure accessibility (plain language, logical flow).

### Spelling & Grammar

- Always use Oxford English spelling (e.g., organise, recognise, analyse).
- Use correct grammar and punctuation throughout.

### Avoid

- Overly casual tone (slang, memes, excessive emojis).
- Long, dense paragraphs that are hard to scan.
- Jargon or abbreviations without explanation.
- Switching between styles — keep one consistent voice.
