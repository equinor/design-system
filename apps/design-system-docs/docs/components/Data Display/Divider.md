# Divider

A _divider_ is a thin line that separates content into clear groups.

## Guidelines

Dividers are subtle ways to group sections, and can only be used in the colours `**UI Background/Default**`, `**UI Background/Light**` and `**UI Background/Medium**`. Dividers can be used full-width where allowed by parent container, or attached to a column's width.

## Implementation in Figma

### Instructions

1. In Figma go to the **Assets Panel** and search for **divider**.
2. Drag and drop the component in your frame.
3. Choose the variant from the **Design Panel**.
