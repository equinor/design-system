## When to Use

The `Divider` brings clarity to layout by grouping and dividing content into groups.

- Dividers should be noticeable in a layout, but not clashing
- Dividers should only be used if elements can't be split using white space
- Use dividers occasionally, to create groupings rather than separate individual items
- Dividers can be used to establish rhythm and hierarchy

## Structure

- Medium
- Small

## Guidelines

Dividers are subtle ways to group sections, and can only be used in the colours `**UI Background/Default**`, `**UI Background/Light**` and `**UI Background/Medium**`. Dividers can be used full-width where allowed by parent container, or attached to a column's width.

## Implementation in Figma

1. In Figma go to the **Assets Panel** and search for **divider**.
2. Drag and drop the component in your frame.
3. Choose the variant from the **Design Panel**.
