# List

_Lists_ organise information into related groups of content.

## When to use
Lists are a continuous group of text.

- Lists should be sorted in logical ways that make content easy to scan
- Lists present content in a way that makes it easy to identify

### Structure

#### Ordered

## Guidelines

Bulleted lists are used when order is not of importance. Numbered lists are used when order and hierarchy are needed.

## Implementation in Figma

1. In Figma go to the **Assets Panel** and search for **lists**.
2. Drag and drop the component in your frame.
3. Choose the variant from the **Design Panel**.

## Do's and don'ts

✅  Use list with one line text, ordered or unordered

❌  Do not use lists to organise large amount of information, use a Table instead

❌  Do not use lists as navigation
