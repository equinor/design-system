# Card

A card displays content related to a single subject and acts as an entry point to more detailed information. Card blocks can be combined in a variety of ways.

## When to Use

- Display content related to a single subject.
- Act as an entry point to more detailed information.

## Structure

- The `container` is the only required block in a card. There are four available `card/container` options.
- There are eleven title blocks to choose between.
- There are three rich media blocks to choose between: `rich-media/last` (use when it is the last block), `rich-media/leading-image` (use when it is the first block), and `rich-media/middle` (use when it is between other blocks).
- Rich media blocks can have graphs, tables, images (within the grid when between blocks and full width when leading), and dividers.
- Supplemental actions are represented by buttons, icons, UI controls and supporting text. There are three supplemental action blocks to choose between.
- Supplemental action blocks can have supplemental actions, dividers (content that can be expanded should use full-width dividers, ignoring the horizontal spacing), an overflow menu, UI controls and chips.

## Guidelines

- Place supplemental actions at the bottom of a card.

## Accessibility

When expanded use tab to review current page headings and press enter or space to navigate to the selected section.
