# Card

A card is a thoughtfully designed container that displays content related to a single subject, creating an inviting entry point to more detailed information. Designed with care to organize information in digestible blocks, cards inspire users to explore content while maintaining visual clarity and purposeful navigation throughout our interfaces.

## When to Use

Use cards when you want to present content in organized, scannable blocks that help users navigate information efficiently. Cards are perfect for displaying related content that benefits from clear boundaries and visual hierarchy, making complex information feel approachable and actionable.

## Structure

The card consists of flexible, thoughtfully organized elements that work together seamlessly:

- **Container** serves as the foundation and is the only required element, with four available options to suit different needs
- **Title blocks** provide clear headings with eleven variations to match your content structure
- **Rich media blocks** showcase visual content with three strategic placements:
  - Leading image for impactful first impressions
  - Middle placement for content flow
  - Last position for supporting visuals
- **Rich media content** can include graphs, tables, images, and dividers that enhance understanding
- **Supplemental actions** offer users clear next steps through buttons, icons, controls, and supporting text
- **Action blocks** can contain various interactive elements including overflow menus, controls, and chips

Each element is designed to create meaningful connections between content and user actions.

## Guidelines

- Place supplemental actions at the bottom of a card to create a natural flow from content to action
- Use full-width dividers for expandable content, ignoring horizontal spacing to create clear visual separation
- Choose container types that best support your content hierarchy and user needs
- Ensure rich media placement supports the story you're telling - leading images for impact, middle placement for context, and trailing media for support
- Combine card blocks thoughtfully to create cohesive information architecture that guides users naturally through the content

## Accessibility

Cards are designed with accessibility in mind to ensure all users can navigate and interact with content effectively. Use proper heading hierarchy within cards and ensure interactive elements have clear focus indicators and descriptive labels.
