# Toolbar

A toolbar is a set of calls to action that allows users to apply changes and/or navigate in a page or product.

## When to Use

- Ensure custom navigation within a page or product.
- Apply changes to a page using actionable controls.
- Use controls with different functionalities when needed.

## Structure

- EDS supports two types:
  - Fixed — used full-width at the top of the page.
  - Freestanding — placed statically on a page, width adapting to the content.

## Guidelines

- Use a fixed toolbar when it should span the full width at the top of the page.
- Use a freestanding toolbar when it should sit within the page layout and adapt to content width.

## Accessibility

When expanded use tab to review current page headings and press enter or space to navigate to the selected section.
