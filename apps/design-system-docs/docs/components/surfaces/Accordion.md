# Accordion

An accordion is a thoughtfully designed component that empowers users to collapse and expand sections of content, creating a clean and organized interface. Designed with care to help manage information density while maintaining usability, accordions inspire focused exploration and keep our pages scannable and purposeful.

## When to Use

Use accordions when you need to present large amounts of related information in user-controlled sections. Accordions are perfect for grouping or organizing content that helps maintain order and scannability on a page, allowing users to focus on what matters most to them while keeping secondary information easily accessible.

## Structure

The accordion consists of:

- **Header area** that serves as the interactive element for expanding and collapsing sections
- **Content area** that appears when expanded, revealing detailed information
- **Clear visual hierarchy** that guides users through their exploration

Each accordion is composed of these essential elements working together to deliver information in digestible, user-controlled sections.

## Guidelines

### Header area

Whether expanded or collapsed, the header height must be 48px. The header area must contain one action indicating that the section expands or collapses and can contain additional actions. The expand/collapse functionality is tied to the entire header. Additional actions are triggered only by interacting directly with that action.

#### Labels

Labels should be to the point, short and no more than three words. Note that if the label is longer than the maximum width, it will be truncated and should have a tooltip provided.

### Content area

When the accordion is expanded, the minimum height for the content area is 96px. There is no maximum height for the content area.

### Interaction

Multiple sections can be expanded simultaneously.
