# Accordion

An _accordion_ allows users to collapse and expand sections of content.

## Usage

Accordions are composed of a header area and a content area. They deliver large amounts of information in user-controlled sections. They can be used to group or hide information which helps to keep order and scannability on a page.

### Simple

### Different types of headers

  

## Guidelines

### Header area

Whether expanded or collapsed, the header height must be 48px. The header area must contain one action indicating that the section expands or collapses and can contain additional actions. The expand/collapse functionality is tied to the entire header. Additional actions are triggered only by interacting directly with that action.

#### Labels

Labels should be to the point, short and no more than three words. Note that if the label is longer than the maximum width, it will be truncated and should have a  provided.

### Content area

When the accordion is expanded, the minimum height for the content area is 96px. There is no maximum height for the content area.

### Interaction

Multiple sections can be expanded simultaneously.
