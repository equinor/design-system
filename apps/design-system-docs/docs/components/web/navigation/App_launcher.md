# App launcher

An _app launcher_ provides navigation for applications related to the application the user is currently viewing.

## Guidelines

An app launcher is used to organise navigation across different applications related or relevant to the current application. The current application shows as _active_ in the app launcher. Each application displayed has a `Product icon` as well as a label that gives clear and concise direction. Note that if the label is longer than the maximum width, it will be truncated and should have a tooltip provided.



# Design

When expanded use tab to review current page headings and press enter or space to navigate to the selected section
