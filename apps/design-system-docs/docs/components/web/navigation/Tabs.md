**More examples available in** **.**

## Guidelines

Tabs allow for navigation between content that is related and has an equal hierarchy. Each tab's content should be noticeably different from the other. Tabs allow for information to be presented in a space-saving layout.

### Width

Tab width can be decided by three factors:

1.  The width of the space available being equally divided by the number of tabs. This method is only to be used for four tabs or less.
    
2.  The width of the widest tab determining the width of all the tabs to provide visual balance. This should be used with caution ensuring all tabs will be seen in smaller layouts.
    
3.  Each tab having its own minimum width to conserve space.
    

  

### Content

#### Labels

Tab labels should provide clear and concise direction. Note that if the label is longer than the maximum width it will be truncated and should have a tooltip provided.

## Exceptions

If the `Navigation: Navigation Drawer` is not used, tabs may be used in the `Navigation: Top Bar` as the main navigation linking to unrelated pages.
