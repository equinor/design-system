# Sidebar

_Sidebar_  is used to display single level navigational destinations

## Guidelines

The sidebar will be permanently visible with optionally a collapse/expand functionality. In collapsed mode the destination items are represented with an icon only, and a tooltip should be used.

Its height should fill the height of the screen, and will not be scrollable.

Sidebar should be used for more than 3 top level destinations that that need to be accessible anywhere in the app.

The sidebar Shouldn’t be used for secondary navigation destinations or less than 3 destinations.



# Design

When expanded use tab to review current page headings and press enter or space to navigate to the selected section
