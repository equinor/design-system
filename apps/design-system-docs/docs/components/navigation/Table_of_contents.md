# Table of contents

_A table of contents_ is a list of hyperlinks that scroll to anchored text on the same page.

## Guidelines

Table of contents, also known as _anchors_ or _article navigation_, link to anchored sections on a page. They always link to the current page. Table of contents can be placed either under the main heading and scroll away with the page, or to the right of the page's main content and be sticky.

## Accessibility

When expanded use tab to review current page headings and press enter or space to navigate to the selected section.
