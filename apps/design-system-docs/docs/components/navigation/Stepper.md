# Stepper

Steppers guide users through the steps of a task.

## When to Use

Use when a task is multi-step, complex, or benefits from clear progress visibility. Avoid for simple single-step submissions. (More detailed criteria to be added soon.)

## Structure

- Container / stepper track
- Individual step (icon or number + label)
- Current step indicator
- Completed step state
- Optional description or helper text – To be added soon
  Details on vertical vs horizontal variants to be added soon.

## Guidelines

When a task is more advanced or complicated, the stepper gives users awareness of where they are in the process.

Content:

- Avoid titles that are too long (aim ≤3 words)
- Keep step labels concise and meaningful
- Use active tense
- Do not mix nouns and verbs across labels
- Use icons that clearly communicate purpose

Do:

- Show a distinct current state vs completed vs upcoming
- Keep label wording consistent in style

Don’t:

- Overload steps with long descriptive text
- Change step order dynamically without feedback

## Accessibility

Accessibility specifics (aria orientation, labelling for current step, announcing progress changes) to be added soon.

## Implementation in Figma

To be added soon

## Code Example

For implementation details and usage examples, please refer to our Storybook documentation.

## Support

Further guidance on error states, branching flows, and mobile condensation will be added soon. Reach out if needed sooner.
