# Link

Links are primarily used as interactive navigational elements, though they can also change how data is viewed.

## When to Use

Use a link when navigating to a different location or resource. Use a button instead if the action triggers a state change on the same page or modifies data. More detailed criteria to be added soon.

## Structure

- Text label (required)
- Optional leading or trailing icon (when clarifying external, download, etc.) – Icon usage nuances to be added soon
- Optional underline (may be removed in specific low‑clutter contexts)

## Guidelines

Links can appear inline within body text, ordered lists, or unordered lists—always as text. They are underlined and use an interactive colour. The underline may be omitted when paired with an icon that strongly implies interaction or when visual noise is a concern (note: this can impact accessibility; evaluate carefully).

Link vs button: A button performs an action (usually same page). A link navigates elsewhere. If the interaction changes data, prefer a button.

Content:

- Keep link text as short as possible.
- Avoid generic phrases like “Click here” or “Read more”; use destination‑specific labels.

## Accessibility

Accessibility specifics (focus states, colour contrast ratios, icon-only link guidance, external link indication) to be added soon.

## Implementation in Figma

To be added soon

## Code Example

For implementation details and usage examples, please refer to our Storybook documentation.

## Support

Additional guidance on external link icons, visited state styling, and keyboard focus patterns will be added soon. Reach out if you need this sooner.
