# Link

### Not in SB

_Links_ are primarily used as interactive navigational elements, though they can also change how data is viewed.

## When to Use

A button is used when performing an action. Actions are almost always on the same page. A link is used when navigating to another place. If the action will change the data, use a button.

## Guidelines

Links can be used on their own in body text, ordered lists or unordered lists, but always as text.

Links are underlined and should always be in an `Interactive` colour.

### Content

- Keep link text as short as possible.
- If possible, avoid terms like **Click here** or **Read more**--instead, use meaningful labels that explain the destination.

## Accessibility

The link style can be used without the underline when it is paired with an icon that implies interaction or when it causes unnecessary visual clutter. This does not meet all the accessibility guidelines, but it is sometimes more useful to not overload visually.

## Do's and don'ts

✅  Use links as navigational elements

✅  Truncate longer labels to fit on one line

❌  Do not use links for actions such as ``submit`` or ``create new``
