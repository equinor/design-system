# Pagination

_Pagination_ allows long sets of data or content to be divided into multiple pages with controls to navigate between these pages.

## Usage

When content will take a long time to load or is better viewed in smaller sets, pagination can be used to divide this content into multiple pages. Pagination only loads one page at a time. Do not lazy load content as the user scrolls when using pagination.



# Design

When expanded use tab to review current page headings and press enter or space to navigate to the selected section
