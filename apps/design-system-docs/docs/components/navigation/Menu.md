# Menu

A menu (dropdown) is a temporary list of actions or functions.

## When to Use

To be added soon

## Structure

- Trigger control (button or icon button) – specifics incomplete in source (to be added soon)
- Menu container (overlay)
- Menu items (actions/functions)
- Optional group dividers (full-width allowed)
- Optional cascading submenu trigger (parent item)
- Compact variant – details to be added soon

## Guidelines

A menu should always be triggered from another control (source text is incomplete; exact trigger patterns to be added soon). It can be dismissed by pressing `Escape`, clicking outside, or selecting an item. Full-width dividers may group related actions. Menus may cascade to expose hierarchical or extended sets of choices; cascading menus open to the right (or left if no space).

Content:

- Keep item labels as short as possible
- Use meaningful labels that explain the function
- Use active tense
- Do not mix nouns and verbs within the same list

Do:

- Group related actions with dividers when it clarifies meaning
- Provide clear trigger affordance

Don’t:

- Over-nest cascading levels (depth guidance to be added soon)
- Rely only on iconography without labels (unless universally understood)

## Accessibility

Accessibility specifics (focus order, roles, aria attributes, submenu keyboard navigation) to be added soon.

## Implementation in Figma

To be added soon

## Code Example
