# Top bar

The top bar, also known as a header, displays navigation and actions relating to the interface.

## Guidelines

Top bars span the full width of the viewport and are always the topmost component on a page. The top bar does not scroll away, being a consistent guidepost to users.

The top bar always has a title which is the same throughout the whole application group. A subtitle is allowed, this can be the same throughout the whole application group, or can be specific to sub-apps within the application.

The top bar has one _optional_ main navigational icon button which is always to the far left. This icon can either open the `App launcher` or toggle the `Navigation Drawer`.

The center block of the top bar can either be left empty, or custom content can be inserted into the placeholder.

Custom content allowed:

- Tabs (Tabs are allowed with nested menus)
- Search bars
- Buttons as menus

The actions on the far-right are standard. This area is for the following common actions within the application:

- Fullscreen: Users can choose to launch the interface to be fullscreen.
- Notifications: This opens a `Menu` for the user to see their notifications.
- Accessibility: This opens a `Menu` with choices for the users to choose light/dark mode and their font size. _This button is mandatory to keep._
- User profile: This opens a `Menu` where the user can see more account details and log out. _This button is mandatory to keep._
