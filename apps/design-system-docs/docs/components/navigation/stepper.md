# Stepper

### Not in SB

_Steppers_ guide users through the steps of a task, creating clear pathways that help users navigate complex processes with confidence and clarity.

## When to Use

When a task is more advanced or complicated, visual help from a stepper lets the user know where they are in the current process.

## Guidelines

- Avoid titles that are too long. Titles should be to the point and short, no more than three words if possible
- Keep the item labels as short as possible
- Use meaningful item labels that explain the function
- Item labels should be in the active tense
- Do not mix nouns and verbs. Pick one or the other
- Always use icons that clearly communicate their intended purpose
