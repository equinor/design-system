# App launcher

When expanded use tab to review current page headings and press enter or space to navigate to the selected section

NAVIGATION

# App launcher

An _app launcher_ provides navigation for applications related to the application the user is currently viewing.

## Guidelines

An app launcher is used to organise navigation across different applications related or relevant to the current application. The current application shows as _active_ in the app launcher. Each application displayed has a `Product icon` as well as a label that gives clear and concise direction. Note that if the label is longer than the maximum width, it will be truncated and should have a tooltip provided.



# Breadcrumbs

When expanded use tab to review current page headings and press enter or space to navigate to the selected section

NAVIGATION

# Breadcrumbs

_Breadcrumbs_ show the navigational path to users allowing them to navigate up the hierarchy.

**More examples available in** **.**

## Guidelines

All links in breadcrumbs are clickable, meaning they all must have a page attached. Breadcrumbs are always placed in the uppermost left corner of the page, but below the .

Breadcrumbs that are many levels deep might not always fit in the space available on a single line, in this case there are three options:

### Auto-collapse

Breadcrumbs can auto-collapse and use ellipses (...) to indicate the middle pages. The first and current/last page are shown in auto-collapsed breadcrumbs. Clicking the ellipses expands the breadcrumbs.

### Expanded breadcrumbs

Expanded breadcrumbs can wrap to two or more lines.

### Truncation

Long labels can be truncated based on pixel width. Truncated labels should always end with an ellipses to indicate there is more text not shown. On hover or long press, a tooltip should appear to show the full label.



# Drawer

When expanded use tab to review current page headings and press enter or space to navigate to the selected section

NAVIGATION

# Drawer

A navigation _drawer_ displays categories of navigational links in a vertical column that can be scrolled.

## Guidelines

A navigation drawer is used to hold navigation with multiple groupings or many levels. Use a navigation drawer when the content has:

-   more sections than would fit in the `Top bar` as tabs.
    
-   two or more levels of navigation hierarchy.
    

Navigation drawer labels should provide clear and concise direction. Note that if the label is longer than the maximum width it will be truncated and should have a tooltip provided.

  

#### Drawer

#### Destination list item



# Link

When expanded use tab to review current page headings and press enter or space to navigate to the selected section

NAVIGATION

# Link

_Links_ are primarily used as interactive navigational elements, though they can also change how data is viewed.

## Guidelines

Links can be used on their own in body text, ordered lists or unordered lists, but always as text.

Links are underlined and should always be in an `Interactive` colour.

The link style can be used without the underline when it is paired with an icon that implies interaction or when it causes unnecessary visual clutter. This does not meet all the accessibility guidelines, but it is sometimes more useful to not overload visually.

### Link vs button

A button is used when performing an action. Actions are almost always on the same page. A link is used when navigating to another place. If the action will change the data, use a button.

### Content

-   Keep link text as short as possible.
    
-   If possible, avoid terms like **Click here** or **Read more**\---instead, use meaningful labels that explain the destination.



# Menu

When expanded use tab to review current page headings and press enter or space to navigate to the selected section

NAVIGATION

# Menu

A _menu_, also known as a dropdown, is a temporary list of actions or functions.

### Compact

  

## Guidelines

A menu should always be triggered from a  _(_using the `Ghost icon` or `Right icon` button) or from a . A menu can be dismissed by pressing `Escape` on the keyboard, clicking outside the menu, or by selecting an action or function in the menu. Full-bleed/full-width dividers are allowed to group content. Menus can be combined to create cascading menus allowing users to choose from a large variety of choices. These are organised by displaying menus with multiple levels of hierarchy. Cascading menus appear to the right of the parent and only on the left if there is no room for expansion on the right.



# Pagination

When expanded use tab to review current page headings and press enter or space to navigate to the selected section

NAVIGATION

# Pagination

_Pagination_ allows long sets of data or content to be divided into multiple pages with controls to navigate between these pages.

## Usage

When content will take a long time to load or is better viewed in smaller sets, pagination can be used to divide this content into multiple pages. Pagination only loads one page at a time. Do not lazy load content as the user scrolls when using pagination.



# Stepper

When expanded use tab to review current page headings and press enter or space to navigate to the selected section

NAVIGATION

# Stepper

_Steppers_ guide users through the steps of a task.

## Guidelines

When a task is more advanced or complicated, visual help from a stepper lets the user know where they are in the current process.

## Content

-   Avoid titles that are too long. Titles should be to the point and short, no more than three words if possible.
    
-   Keep the item labels as short as possible.
    
-   Use meaningful item labels that explain the function.
    
-   Item labels should be in the active tense.
    
-   Do not mix nouns and verbs. Pick one or the other.
    
-   Always use icons that clearly communicate their intended purpose.



# Sidebar

When expanded use tab to review current page headings and press enter or space to navigate to the selected section

NAVIGATION

# Sidebar

_Sidebar_  is used to display single level navigational destinations

## Guidelines

The sidebar will be permanently visible with optionally a collapse/expand functionality. In collapsed mode the destination items are represented with an icon only, and a tooltip should be used.

Its height should fill the height of the screen, and will not be scrollable.

Sidebar should be used for more than 3 top level destinations that that need to be accessible anywhere in the app.

The sidebar Shouldn’t be used for secondary navigation destinations or less than 3 destinations.



# Table of contents

When expanded use tab to review current page headings and press enter or space to navigate to the selected section

# Table of contents

_A table of contents_ is a list of hyperlinks that scroll to anchored text on the same page.

## Guidelines

Table of contents, also known as _anchors_ or _article navigation_, link to anchored sections on a page. They always link to the current page. Table of contents can be placed either under the main heading and scroll away with the page, or to the right of the page's main content and be sticky.



# Top bar

When expanded use tab to review current page headings and press enter or space to navigate to the selected section

NAVIGATION

# Top bar

The _top bar_, also known as a header, displays navigation and actions relating to the interface.

## Guidelines

Top bars span the full width of the viewport and are always the topmost component on a page. The top bar does not scroll away, being a consistent guidepost to users.

## Sections

### Title and navigation

The top bar always has a title which is the same throughout the whole application group. A subtitle is allowed, this can be the same throughout the whole application group, or can be specific to sub-apps within the application.

The top bar has one _optional_ main navigational icon button which is always to the far left. This icon can either open the `App launcher` or toggle the `Navigation Drawer`.

### Center custom content

The center block of the top bar can either be left empty, or custom content can be inserted into the placeholder.

#### Custom content allowed:

-   Tabs
    
    -   Tabs are allowed with nested menus
        
-   Search bars
    
-   Buttons as menus
    

### Actions

The actions on the far-right are standard. This area is for the following common actions within the application:

-   Fullscreen: Users can choose to launch the interface to be fullscreen.
    
-   Notifications: This opens a `Menu` for the user to see their notifications.
    
-   Accessibility: This opens a `Menu` with choices for the users to choose light/dark mode and their font size. _This button is mandatory to keep._
    
-   User profile: This opens a `Menu` where the user can see more account details and log out. _This button is mandatory to keep._



# Tabs

When expanded use tab to review current page headings and press enter or space to navigate to the selected section

NAVIGATION

# Tabs

Tabs organise related content across different views to be quickly navigated.

  

### Default

### With search

**More examples available in** **.**

## Guidelines

Tabs allow for navigation between content that is related and has an equal hierarchy. Each tab's content should be noticeably different from the other. Tabs allow for information to be presented in a space-saving layout.

### Width

Tab width can be decided by three factors:

1.  The width of the space available being equally divided by the number of tabs. This method is only to be used for four tabs or less.
    
2.  The width of the widest tab determining the width of all the tabs to provide visual balance. This should be used with caution ensuring all tabs will be seen in smaller layouts.
    
3.  Each tab having its own minimum width to conserve space.
    

  

### Content

#### Labels

Tab labels should provide clear and concise direction. Note that if the label is longer than the maximum width it will be truncated and should have a tooltip provided.

## Exceptions

If the `Navigation: Navigation Drawer` is not used, tabs may be used in the `Navigation: Top Bar` as the main navigation linking to unrelated pages.
