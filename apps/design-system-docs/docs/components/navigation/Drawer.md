# Drawer

The Drawer is a navigation component that displays categories of links in a vertical column, scrollable when needed. It keeps navigation organized and accessible when there are many items or multiple levels of hierarchy.

---

### When to Use

- The content has more sections than would fit in the Top bar as tabs.
- There are two or more levels of navigation hierarchy.

---

### Structure

- **Drawer container** – holds all categories and can be scrolled vertically.
- **Destination list item** – each link within a category, with a clear label.

When an item's label exceeds the maximum width it is truncated; a tooltip should provide the full text.

---

### Guidelines

- Use a navigation drawer to hold navigation with multiple groupings or many levels.
- Navigation drawer labels should be clear and concise.
- If a label is longer than the maximum width, it will be truncated and must have a tooltip provided.

### Implementation in Figma

1. In Figma go to the **Assets Panel** and search for **Drawer**.
2. Drag and drop the component into your frame.
3. Rename and resize the drawer component if needed.
4. Choose the variant of the destination items from the **Design Panel**.
