# Drawer

A navigation drawer displays categories of navigational links in a vertical column that can be scrolled. We use it to organize navigation with multiple groupings or levels, helping users move efficiently through complex content.

## When to Use

Use a navigation drawer when:

- There are more sections than would fit in the top bar as tabs.
- You need two or more levels of navigation hierarchy.
- Navigation requires grouping or categorization.

Avoid when:

- Navigation is simple and fits in a top bar.
- Only a single level of navigation is needed.

(More detailed criteria to be added soon.)

## Structure

- Drawer container (navigation region)
- Destination list items (links)
- Group headings (optional)
- Scrollable area
- Active state indicator
- Truncated labels with tooltips (for long labels)

Details on markup and grouping to be added soon.

## Guidelines

Do:

- Provide clear and concise labels for navigation items.
- Use tooltips for truncated labels.
- Indicate the active section clearly.

Donâ€™t:

- Overload with rarely used destinations.
- Use inconsistent ordering between pages.

Responsive and accessibility guidelines to be added soon.
