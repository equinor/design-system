# Drawer

A navigation _drawer_ displays categories of navigational links in a vertical column that can be scrolled.

## Guidelines

A navigation drawer is used to hold navigation with multiple groupings or many levels. Use a navigation drawer when the content has:

-   more sections than would fit in the `Top bar` as tabs.
    
-   two or more levels of navigation hierarchy.
    

Navigation drawer labels should provide clear and concise direction. Note that if the label is longer than the maximum width it will be truncated and should have a tooltip provided.
