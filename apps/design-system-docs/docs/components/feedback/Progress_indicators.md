# Progress indicators

_Progress indicators_ are animated helpers that indicate waiting time as content loads.

## When to Use

Progress indicators inform users about the current loading state giving them insight into the process. Determinate progress indicators indicate how long the process will take. They should be used once there is an estimate of wait time available. Indeterminate progress indicators indicate an unknown amount of time the process will take. They should be used when there is _not_ an estimated wait time available.
