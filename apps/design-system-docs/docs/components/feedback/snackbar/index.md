# Snackbar

_Snackbars_ provide brief temporary non-interrupting notifications at the bottom of the screen.

### Simple

-   Snackbars appear without warning, and do not require user interaction.
    
-   When multiple snackbar updates are necessary, they should appear one at a time.
    

  

### With action

A snackbar can contain a single action, a single text button that lets users take action on a process performed by the app.

## Guidelines

Snackbars provide an update on a process that has or will be performed. Snackbars deliver low priority information while  deliver medium priority and  deliver high priority. Snackbars appear centered at the bottom of the screen and disappear without user interaction. On wider screens they are left-aligned. Snackbars appear on-screen between 5-10 seconds before dismissing themselves, so keep text short.

Snackbars can have one action. This action should not be "Close " or "Dismiss" since snackbars disappear automatically. Actions such as "Undo" or "Retry" are acceptable. Snackbars can wrap up to two lines of text on smaller screens.
