# Autocomplete

When expanded use tab to review current page headings and press enter or space to navigate to the selected section

INPUTS

# Autocomplete

The _autocomplete_ (previously called select) component allows users to choose one or multiple items or options from a list.

## Guidelines

A select can be used in different settings:

-   to filter or sort content on a page
    
-   to submit data
    

The `autocomplete` variant is used to choose only one option from a list. The`autocomplete multi` variant is used if multiple choices can be applied.

A `native select` component is also available for implementation. We recommend using native autocomplete on products with limited space as it provides a better user experience.
