# Component group - Inputs

Input components allow users to enter and edit data in forms and interfaces. They provide various ways for users to input information, from simple text to complex selections.

## When to use

Use input components when you need to:

- Collect information from users through forms
- Allow users to search or filter content
- Enable users to configure settings or preferences
- Gather structured data for processing or storage

## Principles

**Clear labeling**  
Every input should have a clear, descriptive label that explains what information is required.

**Appropriate input type**  
Choose the input component that best matches the type of data being collected (text, number, date, selection, etc.).

**Validation and feedback**  
Provide immediate feedback when users enter invalid data, with clear error messages explaining how to fix the issue.

**Accessibility**  
All inputs must be keyboard accessible, work with screen readers, and follow <abbr title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines">WCAG</abbr> 2.1 AA standards.
