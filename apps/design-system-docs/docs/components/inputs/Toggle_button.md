## Guidelines

EDS has one set of primary toggle buttons with either an icon and no text, or text and no icon. When using an icon it must be directly related to the action of the button.

ToggleÂ buttons group a set of related actions in one shared common container. Only one option in a group of toggle buttons can be selected and active at a time. Selecting one option deselects any other.
