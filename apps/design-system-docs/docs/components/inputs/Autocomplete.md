# Autocomplete

The _autocomplete_ (previously called select) component allows users to choose one or multiple items or options from a list.

## When to Use

A select can be used in different settings:

- to filter or sort content on a page
- to submit data

## Guidelines

The `autocomplete` variant is used to choose only one option from a list. The `autocomplete multi` variant is used if multiple choices can be applied.

A `native select` component is also available for implementation. We recommend using native autocomplete on products with limited space as it provides a better user experience.

## Implementation in Figma

### Instructions

1. In Figma go to the **Assets Panel** and search for **autocomplete**
2. Drag and drop the component in your frame
3. Rename and resize the component if needed
4. Choose the variant from the **Design Panel**.
