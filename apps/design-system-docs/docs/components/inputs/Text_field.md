## Guidelines

Text fields are used for long and short amounts of text. `Text inputs` are for a single line of text while `text areas` are for more than a single line of text.

The component includes options for writing unit for the field and a placeholder icon. This component uses auto layout to place an icon and/or unit with the correct spacing next to each other.
