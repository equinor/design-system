## Guidelines

Users can type a term and press `Enter` to see the results. Auto-complete, recent searches, suggested searches and pre/post-scoping are available via the  component.

_Note: Search components as dark theme are only available in Figma._

### Global search

Global search can be used as a primary way of discovering content. The global search placeholder text should always say "Search". The global search should replace the _center custom content, placeholder_ of the `top bar`. The global search can be a button icon that is expanded into the `search field` if search is less common in the application.

### Scope

Scoping allows users to narrow their search before they start. The scope can be changed by opening the menu. The default choice for the scope should always be "All".
