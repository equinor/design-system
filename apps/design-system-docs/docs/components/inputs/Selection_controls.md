# Selection controls

_Selection controls_ allow users to select options, make decisions and set preferences.

## Guidelines

Selection controls are to be visible and understandable at a quick glance. Selected options are more visible than unselected. Selection controls are always accompanied with a clear label. Make sure that the labels are surrounded with a `clickbound` that activates the selection control as well as the control itself.
