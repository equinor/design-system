# Popover

A _popover_ is a floating card that provides more information or actions on hover or click.

## When to Use

Popovers provide excess or additional information that does not fit in the main content area.

## Structure

- Activate on click
- Activate on hover
- Caret direction (indicator) towards the attached area (available in all directions)

## Guidelines

A popover always has an indicator (caret) towards the area in which it is attached. Popovers should never be wider than 560px and their height should not be taller than 80% of the screen.

To dismiss a popover, use the close icon, press the `ESC` key, open another popover or click outside the popover. If there are no actions in the popover, then the close icon should be the first focusable element.

## Accessibility

When expanded use tab to review current page headings and press enter or space to navigate to the selected section
