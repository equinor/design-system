## When to Use

Chips allow users to enter information, make selections, filter content, or trigger actions.

- Chips are **compact** components that represent discrete information
- Chips should be **relevant** to the content or task they represent
- Chips should make tasks easier to complete, or content easier to sort

## Structure

#### Choice chip

Choice chips are used when there are at least two predefined options to choose between to signify the user's choice.
