# List

Lists organise information into related groups of content.

## When to Use

Use unordered lists when order is not important. Use ordered lists when sequence or hierarchy matters. (Additional criteria like semantic depth and accessibility patterns to be added soon.)

## Structure

- Container (ul or ol)
- List items (li)
- Optional nested lists – To be added soon
- Optional starting index (ordered from custom number)

## Guidelines

Bulleted lists are for unordered grouping. Numbered lists are for ordered processes or ranked items. Provide concise, parallel-structured items. Additional guidance on punctuation, capitalization, and nesting limits to be added soon.

Do:

- Keep items grammatically parallel
- Use sentence case (unless proper nouns)

Don’t:

- Over-nest deeply (avoid more than 2 levels) – To be added soon
- Mix ordered and unordered styles arbitrarily

## Accessibility

Ensure correct semantic elements (`ul`, `ol`, `li`). Avoid inserting non-list elements that break hierarchy. Additional guidance (screen reader announcements for nested levels) to be added soon.

## Implementation in Figma

To be added soon

## Code Example

For implementation details and usage examples, please refer to our Storybook documentation.

## Support

Guidance on styling tokens, spacing, and nested list accessibility will be added soon. Reach out if needed earlier.
