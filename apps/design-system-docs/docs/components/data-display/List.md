# List

_Lists_ organise information into related groups of content.


## Guidelines

Bulleted lists are used when order is not of importance. Numbered lists are used when order and hierarchy are needed.

## Usage
Lists are a continuous group of text.

- Lists should be sorted in logical ways that make content easy to scan
- Lists present content in a way that makes it easy to identify

## Accessibility

When expanded use tab to review current page headings and press enter or space to navigate to the selected section

### Variants

- Unordered
- Ordered
- With start option


## Implementation in Figma

### Instructions

2. Drag and drop the component in your frame.
