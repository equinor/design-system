# Divider

A divider is a thin line that separates content into clear groups.

## When to Use

Use to visually separate related content blocks or logical sections. Avoid overuse which can create visual noise. (More detailed criteria to be added soon.)

## Structure

- Line rule (horizontal or vertical context dependent) – Vertical usage details to be added soon
- Spacing above/below defined by layout tokens – To be added soon

## Guidelines

Dividers subtly group sections. Approved colors: UI Background/Default, UI Background/Light, UI Background/Medium. They may span full width or align to a column width. Additional guidance on density, theming, and responsive spacing to be added soon.

Do:

- Use sparingly to clarify grouping
- Align with the content grid

Don’t:

- Stack multiple dividers without content
- Use as a substitute for sufficient whitespace

## Accessibility

Purely decorative when used only as a visual boundary—should not add extraneous semantic elements. Additional guidance (role usage, high-contrast adjustments) to be added soon.

## Implementation in Figma

To be added soon

## Code Example

For implementation details and usage examples, please refer to our Storybook documentation.

## Support

Spacing tokens, vertical variant usage, and theming guidance will be added soon. Reach out if needed earlier.
