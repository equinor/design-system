# Chip

_Chips_, also known as tags or badges, are advanced badges that represent discrete information.

## Guidelines

Chips allow users to make selections, perform an action, input information and attributes, filter content and complete tasks. Chips can transform from free text or predefined text.

### Choice chip

Choice chips are used when there are at least two predefined options to choose between to signify the user's choice.

### Filter chip

Multiple predefined keywords can be listed for the user to choose from. Multiple chips can be selected or unselected.

### Action chip

When there are at least two predefined options to choose between, action chips trigger actions related to the primary content. Action chips are not removable but can appear dynamically.
