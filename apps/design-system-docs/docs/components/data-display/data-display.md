# Component group - Data Display

Data display components present information to users in clear, structured formats. They help organise content so that it is easy to scan, understand, and act upon.

## When to use

Use data display components when you need to:

- Present information in a structured, readable format
- Visualise relationships between pieces of data
- Provide contextual details on demand
- Display lists, tables, or visual indicators alongside content

## Principles

**Clarity first**
Data display components should make information easy to read and understand at a glance. Avoid clutter and prioritise the most important content.

**Consistency**
Use the same data display patterns throughout your application to help users build familiarity and confidence when navigating information.

**Accessibility**
All data display components must be perceivable by assistive technologies and follow <abbr title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines">WCAG</abbr> 2.1 AA standards.
