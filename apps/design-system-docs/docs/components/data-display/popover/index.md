# Popover

A _popover_ is a floating card that provides more information or actions on hover or click.

### Activate on click

### Activate on hover

## Guidelines

Popovers provide excess or additional information that does not fit in the main content area. A popover always has an indicator (caret) towards the area in which it is attached. Popovers should never be wider than 560px and their height should not be taller than 80% of the screen.

To dismiss a popover, use the close icon, press the `ESC` key, open another popover or click outside the popover. If there are no actions in the popover, then the close icon should be the first focusable element.

**Caret** direction is available in all directions
