Components are interactive building blocks for creating a user interface.

An interactive Storybook is available for all developed components (internal link). Use it to explore variants, props, accessibility notes, and usage examples.

## Categories

We group components into five categories to make discovery and decision making easier:

- **Data display** – present information, status, structure or relationships (e.g. tables, lists, visual indicators)
- **Feedback** – communicate progress, results, validation or system state (e.g. dialogs, banners, progress indicators, snackbars)
- **Inputs** – capture and validate user data or choices (e.g. text fields, selection controls, sliders)
- **Navigation** – help users move through content and hierarchies (e.g. menus, breadcrumbs, tabs, sidebars, pagination)
- **Surfaces** – structural or container elements that organise and layer content (e.g. cards, sheets, overlays)

Use the sidebar (or search) to jump directly to a component. Each component page documents usage, accessibility considerations and available props.

If you cannot find a component or need to propose a new one, open an issue describing the use case, constraints and any interim solutions you have considered.
