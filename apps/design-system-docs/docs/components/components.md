# Components

Components are the interactive building blocks of the Equinor Design System (EDS). They translate our foundations—color, spacing, typography, motion, and interaction patterns—into consistent, reusable UI elements that accelerate product delivery while improving quality and accessibility.

Design components are created and maintained in Figma. Production‑ready implementations live in our code packages. Each component page provides guidance, structure, accessibility considerations, and references to usage examples in Storybook.

## Current Focus

We are investing in strengthening the design foundations of EDS before expanding or deeply refactoring higher‑level components. Active foundational work includes:

- Color system refinement (token structure, semantic roles, contrast alignment).
- Spacing scale consolidation to ensure predictable rhythm and density.
- Alignment of component sizing to shared spacing and typography decisions.
- Modernised Figma component architecture (auto layout, variants, tokens) to support scalable evolution.

This groundwork ensures future component updates are more consistent, maintainable, and accessible.

## How to Use Components

Soon be available.

## Contributing

If you identify missing patterns, unclear guidance, or a need for new variants, reach out early. Foundation shifts (like spacing or color tokens) should not be solved locally—coordinate so changes scale.

Contribution guidelines, component proposal process, and design review flow will be documented here. (To be added soon.)

## Categories

Component category grouping will be listed here (e.g. Navigation, Data Display, Inputs, Feedback, Layout) once the taxonomy revision is complete. (To be added soon.)

## Support

Questions, suggestions, or blockers? Use our support channels to engage with the design system team. Your feedback helps prioritize documentation, component improvements, and foundational evolution.
