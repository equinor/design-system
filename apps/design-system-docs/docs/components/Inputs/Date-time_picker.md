## Guidelines

Date pickers are tied to input fields, and are accessed through focusing on the input field by clicking or using the `tab` key. The date picker opens as an overlaying interactive calendar that allows the user to select a date or a range of dates. If a date is chosen, this is reflected in the input field.

Time pickers are tied to input fields, and are accessed through focusing on the input field by clicking or using the `tab` key. The time picker opens as an overlaying list of time that allows the user to select a specific time. If a time is chosen, this is reflected in the input field.
