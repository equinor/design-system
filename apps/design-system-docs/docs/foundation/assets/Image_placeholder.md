## Image placeholder

An image placeholder shows an image in a specific aspect ratio.

## Guidelines

An image placeholder provides a space for the image before it is loaded, this is to avoid the page "jumping" when the image loads. It keeps the aspect ratio of the image. An aspect ratio is the proportional relationship between its width and its height. Informational photography and illustrations are used within these aspect ratios.

## Variations

### Avatar

There are two avatar image placeholders to choose between: **Avatar/Circle** and **Avatar/Square corners**. Avatars can represent users or brands. If a user does not have an image to represent themselves, the user's initials can be used on a solid background.

### Rounded corners

There are five **Rounded corner** aspect ratios available for use: 1:1, 2:1, 4:3, 5:7 and 16:9. 

### Straight corners

There are five **Straight corner** aspect ratios available for use: 1:1, 2:1, 4:3, 5:7 and 16:9.
