# Illustration

Guidelines for illustration and photography styles used throughout the Equinor Design System help you create visually consistent experiences.   

Brand and technical illustrations should follow Equinor's visual identity guidelines to ensure consistency across all your design work.

Please refer to the [Equinor Brand Center](https://communicationtoolbox.equinor.com/brandcenter/en/equinor/component/default/50420) (internal Equinor site) for comprehensive guidelines on creating brand and technical illustrations that align with Equinor's visual identity and communication standards.
