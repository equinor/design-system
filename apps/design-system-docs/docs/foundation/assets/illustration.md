# Illustration

Guidelines for illustration and photography styles used throughout the Equinor Design System help you create visually consistent experiences.

## Brand Illustrations

Brand and technical illustrations should follow Equinor's visual identity guidelines to ensure consistency across all your design work.

Please refer to the Equinor brand guidelines (internal Equinor site) for comprehensive guidelines on creating brand and technical illustrations that align with Equinor's visual identity and communication standards.

## Photography

Our photo style is modern and authentic with a clear Nordic touch that reflects our brand character.

Please refer to the Equinor brand guidelines (internal Equinor site) for detailed guidelines on using photography effectively in your projects. You can download Equinor photos from the internal asset library (internal Equinor site).
