## System Icons

System icons enhance your interfaces by providing clear visual communication for actions, status, and feedback. They help users understand functionality at a glance whilst reducing cognitive load.

## When to Use System Icons

Use system icons for functional elements like buttons, navigation, and interface controls. They work best when paired with labels or when their meaning is universally understood across different contexts.

## Technical Specifications

- **Grid system**: Built on a 24x24px grid for consistency
- **Available sizes**: 24px and 16px (18px for compact mode)
- **Library size**: Over 600 icons organised in logical categories
- **Source**: Based on Google's Material Design icons, customised for Equinor
- **Format**: Available through the EDS icon library and npm package

## Usage Guidelines

**Do**

- Use system icons for interface functions and navigation
- Maintain consistent sizing within your interface
- Pair icons with text labels when meaning might be unclear
- Follow the established grid system for alignment

**Don't**

- Use system icons as product icons or favicons
- Mix different icon styles within the same interface
- Scale icons to non-standard sizes without considering readability

## Using System Icons in Figma

1. Open the **Assets** tab in the Layers Panel
2. Search for specific icons using the search bar or browse through organised folders
3. Drag the icon component into your frame or artboard
4. Hold **Shift** when resizing to maintain aspect ratio

## Contributing New System Icons

Missing a system icon for your interface? You can contribute new icons following our design guidelines.

### Before You Start

- Search thoroughly using all relevant keywords to ensure the icon doesn't already exist
- Ensure your icon will be universally understandable across languages and cultures
- Consider if existing icons can be reused for your purpose

### Design Requirements

**Visual Style**

- Reduce each icon to its minimal form—bold, geometric, and symmetrical
- Apply 2px rounded corners where possible (keep internal corners square)
- Use consistent 2px stroke weight throughout all elements
- Create outline versions as default, with filled variations only when needed
- Keep designs facing forward, never rotated or dimensional

**Technical Standards**

- Align all artwork to the pixel grid
- Avoid centre borders (they create half pixels)
- Use rectangle tool instead of line tool when possible
- Outline (expand) any borders or line work before submission

### Creating Your Icon

1. **Set up your workspace**
   - Create a 24x24px artboard
   - Add the System icon grid from the Assets File Utilities page
   - Lock the grid layer and choose your grid shape

2. **Design guidelines**
   - Follow the 2px stroke weight consistently
   - Apply appropriate rounded corners following brand guidelines
   - Ensure legibility at small sizes

3. **Handle complex shapes**
   - For extremely complex shapes, you may use 1.5px strokes as optical corrections
   - Use this exception sparingly—only when necessary for legibility

### Submitting Your Icon

When your icon is ready for submission:

1. **Clean up your file**
   - Remove and unlock the grid layer
   - Ensure the icon isn't grouped or nested
   - Name all layers logically

2. **Name your icon appropriately**
   - Use descriptive, searchable names
   - Avoid interpretative names that make searching difficult
   - For filled variants, specify in the name (e.g., "add circle filled" and "add circle outlined")

3. **Provide context**
   - Select an appropriate category from existing library categories
   - Supply alternative names people might search for
   - Contact the EDS core team designers for guidance and submission

System icons enhance interfaces by adding visual communication to actions, status and feedback while reducing cognitive load. They are to provide meaning at a glance.

## Guidelines

The EDS system icons are built on a copy of the  provided open-source by Google. The icons have been customised and renamed for Equinor's use and are available in .

There are over 600 icons available divided in logical categories to make them easy to find.

Simple and clear icons require a strict underlying grid. The EDS icons are built on a 24x24px grid. System icons can be used in 24px and 16px sizes. However, when using compact mode the size of icons is 18px.

**Don't**

- System icons are not to be used as product icons or as a favicon.

## Implementation in Figma

### Instructions

1.  Locate the **Assets** tab in the **Layers Panel**.
2.  There are two ways to locate the `System icon` component needed:
    1.  Use the search bar to search for a component grouping name or variation name.
    2.  Scroll through the folders list and open the relevant grouping.

3.  Once the component needed is located, click and drag it into the frame/artboard.
4.  Hold `Shift` when resizing the `System icon` to retain its aspect ratio.

Missing a system icon? You can make it following these simple guidelines.

- First make sure that the icon you are missing does not already exist by searching for all associated keywords in the library.
- All icons should be understandable---regardless of language or location.

## Style

Each icon needs to be reduced to its minimal form --- being bold, geometrical and symmetrical. To reflect the rounded corners of the logo, icons need to have rounded corners of 2px where possible; however, internal corners should be square and not rounded. To reflect the brand, icons use a consistent stroke of 2px --- this includes curves, angles and both interior and exterior strokes. The default icon is outline, a filled icon may be provided only if there is an outlined icon.

The EDS icons are always facing forward and never rotated or dimensional. The icons are made for legibility and are not too literal or complex, neither are they overly playful or bubbly.

**Exceptions**

Extremely complex shapes sometimes require complex details. The guidelines allow for subtle adjustments that help improve legibility of icons --- these adjustments are referred to as **optical corrections**. This exception allows for use of 1.5px internal or external strokes. Using this exception should be avoided if possible.

## Making a new icon

- Create an artboard that is 24x24px.
  - Place the `System icon grid` from the **Utilities** page in **Assets File** as the bottom layer and lock it.
  - Choose the grid shape: circle, square, vertical rectangle or horizontal rectangle.
  - Make sure to align all artwork to the pixel grid.

- Never use centre borders --- centering can cause half pixels.
- Avoid using the line tool, use the rectangle tool instead since the line tool will align to half pixels.
- If you end up using borders or the line tool (which is not recommended), make certain to outline (expand) your work.

## Submitting your new icon

- When your icon has been created, delete the `System icon grid` layer that you had locked.
- Make sure your icon is not grouped or nested.
- Make sure all your layers are named logically.
- Make sure to name the icon what it is --- avoid interpretive names that will make the icon hard to search and find.
  - If you make a filled icon to supplement the outlined icon, both icons need to have this stated in their name. For example, `add circle filled` and `add circle outlined`.

- Pick a category for the icon to live under. Reference the library for current categories.
- Supply a list of alternative names that people might associate with your icon. This will help when searching.
- with the EDS core team designers for further assistance.
