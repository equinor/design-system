# Logos
The logo is used with care to brand interfaces.

## Guidelines

For internal interfaces, the Equinor logo is used sparingly as users have already logged into the Equinor network. The logo, star symbol and favicon can be used in Energy red or White. Always use the logo spacing that is provided, it is built into each component. This ensures the logo maintains its visual integrity.

:::danger Don't
- Do not use the logo in Energy Red over a Black background.
- Do not use the logo over photography.
- Do not add any shadows, gradients, outlines or lighting effects.
- Do not change the proportions, rotate or tilt the logo.
:::

The logo should not be used as a link in internal interfaces. This can cause confusion as the logo could be thought to link to www.equinor.com.

## Variations

### Main logo

The preferred use of branding with the logo for internal interfaces is via splash screens. For interfaces, only the horizontal logo is used and it must have a minimum height of 48px.

### Star symbol

The Equinor star can be used on splash screens and in animations. The Equinor star cannot be used as an app icon, as it is used for the main Equinor app icon, all other apps should have unique icons.

### Favicon

The favicon can be used at 16px or 32px. The favicon cannot be used in any other use cases than a favicon.
