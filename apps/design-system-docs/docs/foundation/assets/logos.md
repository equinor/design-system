title: Logos

---

The Equinor logo represents our brand identity and should be used thoughtfully across all interfaces to maintain visual consistency and brand recognition.

## When to Use Logos

For internal interfaces, use the Equinor logo sparingly since users have already logged into the Equinor network. The logo works best on splash screens and key branding moments where brand reinforcement adds value to the user experience.

## Available Variations

You can use the logo, star symbol, and favicon in **Energy Red** or **White** depending on your interface needs. Always maintain the built-in spacing that comes with each component—this preserves the logo's visual integrity and ensures consistent application.

### Main Logo

Use the horizontal logo for interface branding, particularly on splash screens. The logo must maintain a minimum height of 48px to ensure legibility and proper brand representation across different screen sizes.

### Star Symbol

The Equinor star works well on splash screens and in animations where you need a simplified brand element. However, avoid using the star as an app icon since it's reserved for the main Equinor app—each application should have its own unique icon for clear identification.

### Favicon

Use the favicon at 16px or 32px sizes specifically for browser tabs and bookmarks. This variation is designed exclusively for favicon purposes and shouldn't be used in other contexts.

## Usage Guidelines

:::info **Do**

- Use the provided spacing built into each logo component
- Maintain the minimum 48px height for the main logo
- Choose appropriate colour variations (Energy Red or White) based on your background
- Reserve logo usage for key branding moments in internal interfaces
  :::

:::danger **Don't**

- Use the logo in Energy Red over a Black background (poor contrast)
- Place the logo over photography (reduces legibility)
- Add shadows, gradients, outlines, or lighting effects
- Change proportions, rotate, or tilt the logo
- Use the logo as a clickable link in internal interfaces (this can confuse users who might expect it to navigate to external sites)
- Use the star symbol as an app icon (reserved for the main Equinor app)
