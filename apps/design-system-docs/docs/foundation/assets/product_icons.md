## Contributing New Product Icons

Missing a product icon for your project? You can contribute new icons following our brand guidelines.

### Before You Start

- Search thoroughly using all relevant keywords to ensure the icon doesn't already exist
- Consider reusing existing icons when appropriate
- Ensure your icon will be universally understandable across languages and cultures

### Design Requirements

**Visual Style**

- Use simple, single-colour keylines only
- Apply 1px rounded corners throughout (reflecting the Equinor logo)
- Maintain 1px consistent stroke weight for all elements
- Keep designs facing forward, never rotated or dimensional
- Limit complexity to maximum three objects

**Technical Standards**

- Create outline-only icons (no filled versions)
- Avoid multiple stroke weights or square corners
- No hands holding objects or overly complex details
- Maintain bold, geometric, and symmetrical designs

### Creating Your Icon

1. **Set up your workspace**
   - Create a 48x48px artboard
   - Add the Product icon grid from the Assets File Utilities page
   - Lock the grid layer and select your preferred grid shape

2. **Design your icon**
   - Align all artwork to the pixel grid
   - Avoid centre borders (they create half pixels)
   - If using borders or line tools, outline (expand) your work before submission

3. **Prepare for submission**
   - Remove and unlock the grid layer
   - Ensure the icon isn't grouped or nested
   - Name all layers logically
   - Use descriptive, searchable names for your icon

### Submitting Your Icon
