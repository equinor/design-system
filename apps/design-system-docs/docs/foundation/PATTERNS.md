# Grid alignment

The organisation of space is key to every great design. By aligning your component to a grid, you will provide visual structure throughout your product.

## Guidelines

Using a grid as a starting point for your component implementation will help you arrange your content into structured proportions. You also have to keep in mind that EDS is based on an 8px ratio. This means that you always have to keep a minimum of 8px between objects and elements. Please read the  page for general guidelines.

## Best practices

### Don’t

-   Do not use less than 8px between each components.
    
-   If some of your objects are aligned to the grid do not set other objects off-grid.
    

### Align object within a frame

As you have applied the grid size to your frame, you can use the columns to place your objects. It is recommended that you keep all your objects within the columns. In some cases you might need to be off-grid. You should then keep in mind the 8px ratio between elements.

Grids can also be used inside components. Make sure you use the correct grid according to the size of your component. Those components can be imported in your frame where another grid size has been applied.

PATTERNS

# Inputs

Inputs are fields or menus that allow the user to write custom input or make a selection out of predefined choices.

## Menu

A menu (also known as a dropdown) displays a list of choices on temporary surfaces allowing the user to make one or multiple selections. The elements needed to create a menu in Figma are the `menu container` and `menu items`. An interaction with an icon, button or other control is needed for the menu to appear. Menus should be easily scannable, easy to interact with and suited to the user's needs.

## Multiselect dropdown menu

Watch the short video below to learn how to make a multiselect dropdown menu. All the other dropdown menus in the example image above follow the same convention, and can easily be made by adding some extra components. The selected items could be shown with checkboxes or chips inside the field, inside the menu or below the field.

## Contextual menu

Contextual menus appear next to where a user right clicks. The menu displays a set of actions related to the object that has been selected, based on the application's current state.

PATTERNS

# Placement and order

In oder to place your objects and components correctly, you must always keep in mind the reading pattern of your user. Two types of patterns can be encountered: F and Z.

## Reading patterns

### The F reading pattern

The F-shaped scanning pattern is characterised by many fixations concentrated at the top and the left side of the page.

Users first read in a horizontal movement, usually across the upper part of the content area. They will then move down the page a bit and then read across in a second horizontal movement that typically covers a shorter area than the previous movement. This additional element forms the F’s lower bar.

The main interaction should then be aligned on the left.

### The Z reading pattern

The Z-shaped scanning traces the route the human eye travels when they scan the page — left to right, top to bottom.

Users first read in a horizontal movement, usually across the upper part of the content area. They will then move down and to the left side of the page creating a diagonal line, and then move back across to the right again forming a second horizontal line.

The main interaction should then be aligned on the left.

### Placement of buttons

Buttons in dialog windows should in most cases be placed in the bottom right corner and supplemental actions should be placed on the opposite side of the dialog than the main button group.
