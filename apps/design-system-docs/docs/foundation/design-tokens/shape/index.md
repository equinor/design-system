# Shape

Components can have many different shapes. Establishing a common shape keeps consistency.

## Guidelines

To reflect the round corners of the Equinor logo, our shapes have a default rounded corner of 4px. You will notice this in the corners of buttons, cards, menus and more.

## Variations

There are many different shapes to choose between when you are building a component such as: `Button`, `Icon button`,  `Corners`,  `Straight`,  `Field`  and `Circle`.
