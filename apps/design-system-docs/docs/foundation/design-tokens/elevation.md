# Elevation

Elevation is a visual effect that makes an element look like it's floating above the surface (using the z-axis).

## Guidelines

The elevation effect is made using shadows to help lift an element into focus, it is a reference to the physical world. Elements may be stacked on top of each other but can’t pass through each other.

## Styles

There are six elevation effects to choose between:  `None`,  `Raised`,  `Overlay`,  `Sticky`,  `Temporary nav` and `Above scrim`.

## Implementation in Figma

### How to add

1.  Locate the _layer_ in the **Layers Panel** that needs elevation applied.
    
2.  Locate the **Design** tab in the **Inspector Panel**.
    
3.  Under the **Effects** section, open the **Style library** menu to view the elevation styles.
    
4.  Choose a style by clicking on the elevation needed.
