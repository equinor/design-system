# Image placeholder

An image placeholder shows an image in a specific aspect ratio.

## Guidelines

An image placeholder provides a space for the image before it is loaded, this is to avoid the page "jumping" when the image loads. It keeps the aspect ratio of the image. An aspect ratio is the proportional relationship between its width and its height. Informational photography and illustrations are used within these aspect ratios.

## Variations

### Avatar

There are two avatar image placeholders to choose between: **Avatar/Circle** and **Avatar/Square corners**. Avatars can represent users or brands. If a user does not have an image to represent themselves, the user's initials can be used on a solid background.

### Rounded corners

There are five **Rounded corner** aspect ratios available for use: 1:1, 2:1, 4:3, 5:7 and 16:9. 

### Straight corners

There are five **Straight corner** aspect ratios available for use: 1:1, 2:1, 4:3, 5:7 and 16:9.

# Logos

The logo is used with care to brand interfaces.

## Guidelines

For internal interfaces, the Equinor logo is used sparingly as users have already logged into the Equinor network. The logo, star symbol and favicon can be used in **Energy red** or **White**. Always use the logo spacing that is provided---it is built into each component. This ensures the logo maintains its visual integrity.

**Don't**

-   Do not use the logo in **Energy Red** over a **Black** background.
    
-   Do not use the logo over photography.
    
-   Do not add any shadows, gradients, outlines or lighting effects.
    
-   Do not change the proportions, rotate or tilt the logo.
    
-   The logo should not be used as a link in internal interfaces. This can cause confusion as the logo could be thought to link to .
    

## Variations

### Main logo

The preferred use of branding with the logo for internal interfaces is via splash screens. For interfaces, only the horizontal logo is used and it must have a minimum height of 48px.

### Star symbol

The Equinor star can be used on splash screens and in animations. The Equinor star cannot be used as an app icon, as it is used for the main Equinor app icon---all other apps should have unique icons.

### Favicon

The favicon can be used at 16px or 32px. The favicon cannot be used in any other use cases than a favicon.

## External use

Please visit the Equinor  for more information about using the Equinor logo.

# Product icons

Product icons communicate key themes and business areas in a clear, simple and branded style. They enhance visual communication, assist with navigation and reduce cognitive load. Product icons do not provide functional interaction---use system icons instead.

## Guidelines

The EDS product icons are built on top of the Equinor  guidelines for iconography.

Product icons are used in app icons, app launchers and splash screens---always with the name of the product they represent. Simple and clear icons require a strict underlying grid. The EDS icons are built on a 48x48px grid. Product icons can scale up, but not down, depending on context in the grid shape.

**Don't**

-   Product icons are not to be used as system icons.
    
-   Product icons are not used for marketing or decoration.

# System icons

System icons enhance interfaces by adding visual communication to actions, status and feedback while reducing cognitive load. They are to provide meaning at a glance.

## Guidelines

The EDS system icons are built on a copy of the  provided open-source by Google. The icons have been customised and renamed for Equinor's use and are available in .

There are over 600 icons available divided in logical categories to make them easy to find.

Simple and clear icons require a strict underlying grid. The EDS icons are built on a 24x24px grid. System icons can be used in 24px and 16px sizes. However, when using compact mode the size of icons is 18px.

**Don't**

-   System icons are not to be used as product icons or as a favicon.
