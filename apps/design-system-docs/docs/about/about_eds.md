# About EDS

Welcome to **Equinor Design System**! We've built this design system to help you create consistent, accessible digital experiences at Equinor. Whether you're designing in Figma, developing with React, or managing projects, EDS provides the tools and guidance you need to succeed.

We believe great design should be accessible to everyone, regardless of your technical background. Our system eliminates the need to recreate basic interface elements, so you can focus your expertise on solving real user problems and delivering exceptional experiences.

## Design Principles

These principles guide every decision we make in developing and maintaining EDS:

**Flexible and adaptable**  
Our components work together seamlessly whilst accommodating diverse use cases and requirements across different projects.

**Accessible by design**  
We prioritise inclusive design from the start, ensuring every element works for users of all abilities and supports assistive technologies.

**Purposeful interaction**  
Motion and interactive elements serve clear functions, helping users understand and navigate interfaces without unnecessary decoration.

**Cross-platform consistency**  
Whether you're building for web, mobile, or desktop applications, EDS maintains the same visual language and interaction patterns.

## Why EDS

EDS was created to support teams across Equinor in building better digital experiences more efficiently. We recognised opportunities to help teams work together more effectively whilst maintaining the high standards our users deserve.

**Shared foundation for efficiency** — EDS provides tested, reusable components that teams can build upon, eliminating the need to recreate similar solutions across different projects and allowing everyone to focus their expertise on solving unique user problems.

**Centralised maintenance** — With components maintained centrally in one place, developers no longer need to spend time maintaining multiple versions of the same interface elements. This approach ensures consistent updates and bug fixes whilst freeing up valuable development time for teams to focus on innovative features and solving complex business challenges.

**Unified brand experience** — We ensure that users have a consistent, professional experience as they navigate between different Equinor applications, strengthening trust and familiarity with our digital services.

**Built-in accessibility** — Every component includes accessibility best practices from the start, helping teams create inclusive experiences that serve all users effectively and meet compliance standards.

**Streamlined collaboration** — EDS provides shared tools and common terminology that enable designers and developers to work together seamlessly, reducing development time and improving communication.

**Quality assurance** — Our centralised approach ensures that interface solutions are thoroughly tested and maintained, giving teams confidence in their implementations and reducing long-term maintenance overhead.

EDS serves as the foundation that empowers teams to create exceptional user experiences whilst working more efficiently and maintaining consistency across all of Equinor's digital touchpoints.
