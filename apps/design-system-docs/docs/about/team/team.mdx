The EDS core team combines expertise in design, development, accessibility, and user experience to maintain and evolve the system. We work closely with Equinor's brand team to ensure every element aligns with corporate identity whilst serving the practical needs of development teams.

We're committed to supporting the broader Equinor community through documentation, training, and ongoing collaboration. Your feedback and contributions help us continuously improve EDS to better serve everyone who uses it.
