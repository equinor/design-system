We're a diverse team combining design, development, accessibility, and user experience expertise to maintain and evolve EDS. Working closely with Equinor's brand team, we ensure every component aligns with corporate identity whilst meeting practical development needs.

We support the Equinor community through documentation, training, and collaboration. Your feedback helps us continuously improve EDS for everyone.

**Our motto**: From ideas to interfaces — we connect the dots.
