# Designers

The Equinor Design System (EDS) will empower you to design consistently and prototype rapidly. It is the official interface library for all of Equinor’s internal digital interfaces

## Figma

Figma has been chosen as the tool for prototyping and design when using the EDS. Visit for details about getting started and working with Figma.

## Device agnostic

All components have been created for interaction on all devices. This means that all interface components can be used easily by mouse, keyboard or touch input. This should help make the EDS future-proof to new technologies.

## Contribution

EDS is based on the contribution of its community. with the EDS core team if you have a feature request or visit the to collaborate with the community.

# Figma

Figma is the selected tool for prototyping and design when using the Equinor design system (EDS).

## Getting access to Figma in Equinor

Instructions for applying for access and first time log in are on .

## Joining an existing team in Figma

Contact your team *admin* or *owner* to add you to the team or search in Figma for the team you wish to join and request access.

- You will be added as a *viewer* by default. If you plan to edit, ask your team *admin* or *owner* to upgrade you.
- *Viewers* can:
  - View and comment on files and projects in which they have access.
  - View a list of *all* teams in the Equinor Figma Organisation.
  - Access the EDS components, styles and fonts.

- *Editors* can do everything a *viewer* can, plus they can create and edit files.

## Creating a team in Figma

Start by reading about on Figma's help pages. New teams are created under the Equinor organisation area. Make sure to search first to ensure the team doesn't already exist. Projects should not be mixed, so make one team per project. Give the team an appropriate name, knowing that anyone in Figma can see the name. Please delete the default project folder **Design System** since this is not the EDS and can cause confusion. The user creating a team becomes the team _owner_, but this can be re-assigned later to another team member.

### Team owner responsibilities

Team _owners_ are the single point of contact for the Figma team, and the Figma administrators and EDS Core team will reach out to them when necessary. Team _owners_ are expected to read and follow the Figma guidelines found here on the EDS storefront.

### Team member management

- _Members_ are users that have access to the Equinor Figma organization.
- By default, members added to a team will be added as a *viewer*.
- It is the *team owner's* choice to upgrade the *viewer* to *editor, owner* or *admin*. If you are unable to upgrade a *viewer* to an *editor*, reach out to .
- Users are currently able to upgrade themselves to an *editor* by transferring a file into the team from their drafts. However, this can be blocked on a user-by-user basis by the *admins* of the Equinor Figma organisation.
- As the team *owner*, it is your responsibility to make sure that *only* those requiring it are *editors*. *Owners*, *admins* and *editors* incur a monthly cost to Equinor---however, *viewers* do not. It is possible to upgrade someone to an *editor* and downgrade them within the same billing cycle.
  - If an *editor* is on an extended leave, change their account to *viewer* and upgrade them when they return.
  - If a team member is no longer part of the team, remove them from the team.

The EDS core team aims to incorporate EDS into low-code tools, currently with a focus on Microsoft's Power Platform which is well integrated with Microsoft 365.

### Canvas App

#### Template

A template for canvas apps is available. See a preview of the template here (Equinor users only):

EDS provides a component library that can be available in development environments. Using components from the EDS component library helps to ensure consistency across solutions and reduces development time through reusability.

#### Documentation and support

Documentation on using the template and the component library is built into the app itself: .

Use to get support or provide feedback about the template or the component library.
