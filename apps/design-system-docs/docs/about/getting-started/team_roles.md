## Teams & Roles

As a team or project lead, you'll find the strategic guidance and practical support you need to successfully implement EDS across your projects and teams.

## Getting Your Team Started

**Assess your team's needs:** Identify which team members need design resources (Figma access) versus development resources (component libraries). This helps you plan appropriate training and access requests.

**Direct team members to role-specific guides:**

- **Designers** → [Figma setup and design workflows](design/index.md)
- **Developers** → [Component installation and implementation](develop/index.md)
- **Citizen Developers** → [Low-code templates and Power Platform resources](develop//citizen_developers.md)

**Plan your implementation approach:** Start with new projects rather than migrating existing work. This reduces risk and allows your team to build confidence with EDS components gradually.

**Coordinate training:** Contact the EDS team for role-specific training sessions. We can help you plan workshops that fit your team's schedule and learning preferences.

## Scaling EDS Adoption

**Start with pilot projects:** Choose one or two new projects to implement EDS first. This gives your team hands-on experience whilst minimising risk to existing work.

**Implement component by component:** You don't need to adopt everything at once. Replace custom components with EDS alternatives gradually as you encounter them in your work.

**Establish quality processes:** Include EDS compliance in your design reviews and code reviews. This ensures consistency and helps team members learn proper usage patterns.

**Measure your success:** Track metrics like design consistency, development velocity, and accessibility compliance. The EDS team can help you identify appropriate success measures for your context.

## Managing Common Challenges

**Handling resistance:** Some team members may prefer existing tools or workflows. Address concerns by highlighting specific benefits for their role and involving skeptics in pilot projects where they can see value firsthand.

**Quality assurance:** Establish clear criteria for EDS compliance in design and code reviews. Document exceptions when teams need to deviate from standard components and ensure exceptions are justified and temporary.

**Timeline impact:** Initial adoption may slow development by 10-20% for 2-4 weeks as teams learn. Plan accordingly and communicate realistic expectations to stakeholders.

## Support and Community

**Get direct support:** We host regular office hours where you can ask questions, get implementation advice, and learn about upcoming features. These sessions connect you directly with the EDS core team and experienced leaders from other teams.

**Connect with peer teams:** Join our community channels to share experiences, discuss challenges, and learn from other team leads. You'll find practical insights from teams who've successfully implemented EDS and can help guide your approach.

**Shape EDS development:** Your feedback matters. Submit feature requests, report issues, and share your team's experiences. This input directly influences system improvements and helps other teams succeed.

**Leadership-specific guidance:** Need strategic support for your implementation? We provide leadership consultation including implementation planning, change management advice, success metrics guidance, and ROI measurement support.

**Common leadership questions answered:**

- **Business value:** EDS reduces design and development time, improves accessibility compliance, and ensures brand consistency. Teams typically see increased velocity after the initial learning period.

- **Implementation timeline:** Most teams become proficient with basic EDS usage within 2-4 weeks. Full adoption across existing projects takes 3-6 months, depending on complexity and team size.

- **Resource requirements:** Plan for initial training time, potential Figma licence costs for designers, and ongoing community participation time. Implementation support is provided at no additional cost.
