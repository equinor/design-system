# Citizen Developers

You can create professional, brand-aligned solutions using low-code tools whilst maintaining the consistency and quality that EDS provides. Our Power Platform integration works seamlessly with the Microsoft 365 tools you already use daily.

## Getting Started

We've made it straightforward to begin building with EDS. You can be up and running in just a few minutes by following these steps:

1. **Access Power Apps** through your Microsoft 365 account
2. **Download EDS templates** from the links provided below
3. **Import templates** into your development environment or workspace
4. **Start building** using pre-configured components and layouts

## Available Tools

### Power Apps

<!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line MD033 -->
We offer a Power Apps canvas app template with pre‑configured components, layout, theming, and interaction patterns aligned to the <abbr title="Equinor Design System">EDS</abbr> guidelines as far as the platform allows. Embedded in‑app documentation covers usage, configuration, accessibility, and extension points so you can adapt safely without breaking consistency.

- Uses EDS colour, spacing, and typography tokens where technically supported
- Includes common screen patterns (dashboard, form, list, detail)
- Provides accessible defaults (labels, focus order, contrast guidance)
- Exposes clearly named components for reuse and replacement
- Documents customisation boundaries and recommended extension steps

Start by importing the template, reviewing the built‑in guidance, and then tailoring the documented configuration areas to keep solutions maintainable and compliant.

### Power BI

We offer light-themed templates covering common business scenarios, with pre-configured charts, layouts, and styling that align with EDS principles. These templates ensure your dashboards maintain consistent visual presentation across all your business intelligence solutions.

We're continuously expanding this collection with more examples and scenarios to support your diverse reporting needs.

## Best Practices

- Use provided templates as your foundation rather than starting from scratch
- Follow EDS colour and typography guidelines when customising elements
- Test your solutions across different devices to ensure responsive behaviour
- Ensure proper colour contrast in all custom elements
- Include alternative text for images and visual components
- Test keyboard navigation functionality
