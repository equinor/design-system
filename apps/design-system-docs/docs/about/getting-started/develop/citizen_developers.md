## Citizen Developers

You can create professional, brand-aligned solutions using low-code tools whilst maintaining the consistency and quality that EDS provides. Our Power Platform integration works seamlessly with the Microsoft 365 tools you already use daily.

## Getting Started

We've made it straightforward to begin building with EDS. You can be up and running in just a few minutes by following these steps:

1. **Access Power Apps** through your Microsoft 365 account
2. **Download EDS templates** from the Power Platform library
3. **Import templates** into your development environment
4. **Start building** using pre-configured components and layouts

## Available Tools

### Power Apps

We provide comprehensive templates for canvas apps that include pre-configured components, layouts, and styling aligned with Equinor's design standards. Our dedicated component library is available in development environments, featuring EDS-compliant elements that ensure consistency whilst reducing development time. Each template includes built-in documentation covering proper usage, customisation options, and best practices.

**Preview the template**: [Canvas Apps Template](https://apps.equinor.com/edspowerapps) (Equinor users only)

### Power BI

We offer light-themed templates covering common business scenarios, with pre-configured charts, layouts, and styling that align with EDS principles. These templates ensure your dashboards maintain consistent visual presentation across all your business intelligence solutions.

**Access templates**: [Power BI EDS App](https://app.powerbi.com/groups/me/apps/eaebdc61-f203-44ae-bdbc-024280a198c0/reports/f1e2d555-b370-48c9-aba6-60cddfd518f5/ReportSection6733e16b600c25762a61?ctid=3aa4a235-b6e2-48d5-9195-7fcf05b459b0)

We're continuously expanding this collection with more examples and scenarios to support your diverse reporting needs.

## Best Practices

- Use provided templates as your foundation rather than starting from scratch
- Follow EDS colour and typography guidelines when customising elements
- Test your solutions across different devices to ensure responsive behaviour
- Ensure proper colour contrast in all custom elements
- Include alternative text for images and visual components
- Test keyboard navigation functionality
