title: Getting started with design
---

You're ready to start designing with EDS. This guide helps you set up Figma access, understand our design workflow, and create your first designs with confidence.

**Prerequisites:** Equinor Figma account access  
**Time to get started:** 5-10 minutes

## Figma Setup

You'll need Figma access to work with EDS design components and libraries:

**Get Figma access** — Apply through internal Equinor resources or contact your team administrator for help with account setup.

**Join your design team** — Contact your team admin to join an existing team, or search for your team in Figma and request access.

For detailed setup instructions, permissions guidance, and workspace organisation, see our [complete Figma guide](Figma.md).

## Start Designing

Once you have Figma access, follow these specific steps to create your first EDS design:

**1. Configure your Figma workspace**

- Open Figma preferences and change nudge amount to 8px (matches EDS grid system)
- Enable the EDS component library in your file's Assets panel
- Create a new frame using standard screen sizes (1440px width for desktop)

**2. Build your first interface**

- Start with layout components like `TopBar` or `SideSheet` for navigation
- Add content using `Typography` components for headings and body text
- Include interactive elements like `Button` or `TextField` components
- Use `Icon` components from the EDS icon library for visual elements

**3. Apply EDS design principles**

- Use the 8px grid system for consistent spacing between elements
- Apply colour tokens for backgrounds, text, and interactive states
- Ensure minimum 3:1 contrast ratio for text (use EDS colour combinations)
- Set focus states for all interactive elements

**4. Test your design**

- Preview your design using Figma's prototype mode
- Check that all interactive elements have proper spacing (minimum 44px touch targets)
- Verify colour contrast meets accessibility standards

## Next Steps

Ready to advance your EDS skills? Here are specific next steps to help you grow:

- **Explore advanced components** — Try data visualisation, navigation, or form components for complex interfaces
- **Join design community channels** — Connect with other designers using EDS and share experiences
- **Propose new components** — Submit requests for components not currently in the system
- **Create design variations** — Learn to customise components whilst maintaining consistency
