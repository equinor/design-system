# Keyboard shortcuts

For users who rely on or prefer using a keyboard, screen reader or voice - it is important to provide functionality that shows focus on all interactive content.
Many users navigate using only their keyboard by `tabbing` between focusable elements to navigate and select content by using the `enter`key or using the `spacebar` to activate an in-focus element.
The user's focus should never move without their actions causing the movement.

When focus is done right, it allows keyboard navigation, voice navigation and screen readers to easily reach the next step. In the EDS we use the `Interactive State/Default/Focused` to show focus around an element.
This is our visual indicator and is designed to have contrast to other elements within the interface.

## Shortcuts

It is important to enable the users to become more efficient as they become more familiar with the interface.
This addresses ergonomic issues, like preventing carpal tunnel syndrome, but also helps to avoid stress and frustration that can be caused if the user performs slow and repetitive tasks.
Keyboard shortcuts should be promoted so the user easily can adopt them along the way.
One way of promoting keyboard shortcuts is in the relevant context in menus and tooltips.

- The `esc`key should always be used to cancel or close.
- The `enter` key should always be used to submit, select or expand.
