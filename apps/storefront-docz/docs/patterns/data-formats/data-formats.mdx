How to format numeric and linguistic data.

## Date and time

Here is an overview of the different accepted formats:

| Type                 | How to use                   | Example                                |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Date, Full           | dddd,MMM D, YYYY, hh:mm:ss Z | Monday, August 3, 2020, 09:31:57 UTC+1 |
| Date, Normal         | ddd,MMM D, YYYY hh:mm        | Mon, Aug 3, 2020, 09:31                |
| Date, Compacy        | MMM D, YYYY hh:mm            | Aug 3, 2020                            |

| Date range example 3 |                              | Aug 3-Aug 7, 2020                      |

## Input formats

It is important to make sure we are as compatible with other systems, therefore we allow some variety within input formats. It is good practice to separate date and hour, but individual considerations will be respected.

We accept three delimiters: Period, dash and slash.

### Accepted input formats

In addition to all standard display formats and standard copy format, the following formats should be accepted for date fields:

| Format     | Entered value | Interpretation |
| ---------- | ------------- | -------------- |
| yyyy/mm/dd | 2020/08/03    | Aug 3, 2020    |
| yyyy.mm.dd | 2020.08.03    | Aug 3, 2020    |
| dd.mm.yyyy | 03.08.2020    | Aug 3, 2020    |
| dd-mm-yyyy | 03-08-2020    | Aug 3, 2020    |
| hh:mm:ss   | 09            | 09:00:00       |

### Relative dates

Considersupporting input relative formats like:

- Today
- Last month
- Month -3
- Today -3d
- etc.

These are especially handy if you generate reports or standard views that should display data relative to today's date.

## Numbers

### Display format

The standard thousands separator is to be used is a space (1 000 000) in contrast to commas or periods (1,000,000 or 1.000.000) to reduce confusion resulting from the variation between these formats in different countries.

Standard decimal separator to be used is a comma, but it is recommended to provide the user with the option to choose regional settings that include decimal separator to be a period ("0.00").

Use of browser settings is not recommended because it is hard (and sometimes impossible due to company restrictions) for the user to change this setting, and it may vary between browsers. This may result the same user being exposed to both formats between clients.

If decimals are hidden the number should be rounded, and it is recommended that the decimals is available in the title tag/tooltip so the user may reveal them with a mouse over.
Correct display format:
x xxx,xxx

### Input formats

To ensure compatibility with numeric pads on English keyboards and pasted values from other sources, period should be accepted as decimal separator for inputs. Same applies in reverse if the user has selected period as decimal separator.
Any use of space in the number input should be accepted but removed to support thousand separators, leading or trailing spaces without generating validation error.

If multiple instances of periods and/or commas are present, only regard the last one.

Accepted input formats

- x
- x.x
- x,xx
- xxxx,xxx
- x xxx.xxx
- x.xxx.xxx
- x,xxx.xxx
- ,x
- .x
