Every part of your interface should be intentional---this includes spacing. While spacing is invisible, it gives air and readability to your interface. Our spacing scale is based on 8px increments.

<!--One to two sentences as an introduction to the component-->

## Guidelines

<!--List how to use it, sizes, widths, grid interactions, color allowances -->

Spacing is used to apply margin and padding across all platforms.
The EDS has a predefined set of spacers. These predefined sizes will ensure consistency across interfaces.  
The spacers `XX Small` and `X Small` are only to be used inside of components, while the spacers `Small` up to `XXX Large` can be used both within and between components.

- Always make sure to follow the [accessibility guidelines](https://eds.equinor.com/guidelines/accessibility/ 'EDS accessibility guidelines') by having 8px of spacing between each clickbound.

## Spacing hierarchy

Too much information without spacing can overwhelm the user. Sufficient spacing helps the user process information and rest the eyes.

- Less spacing between elements imply they relate to each other.
- More spacing between elements imply they do not relate to each other.
- Sufficient spacing around elements helps users process the information.
- Generally, more spacing around an element makes it seem more important.

## Variations

<!--One ### heading per frame in Figma, explaining each component in that frame. One 'content' section per variation if needed -->

### Vertical spacing

There are eight spacers to choose between: `XX Small`, `X Small`, `Small`, `Medium`, `Large`, `X Large`, `XX Large` and `XXX Large`. The spacers `XX Small` and `X Small` are only to be used inside components, while the other spacers are to be used in layouts.

### Horizontal spacing

There are eight spacers to choose between: `XX Small`, `X Small`, `Small`, `Medium`, `Large`, `X Large`, `XX Large` and `XXX Large`. The spacers `XX Small` and `X Small` are only to be used inside components, while the other spacers are to be used in layouts.
