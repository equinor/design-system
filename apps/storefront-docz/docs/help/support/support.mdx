The EDS core team maintains and provides support for the EDS. Components will be revised and expanded as necessary to suit changing needs.

They are available in the Slack channel [#eds-equinor-design-system](https://equinor.slack.com/messages/CJT20H1B9) and can respond to questions as time permits.

Before sending a message, please try searching within the Slack channel first to see if your question has already been asked.
Always remember to reply in threads instead of replying to everyone.
