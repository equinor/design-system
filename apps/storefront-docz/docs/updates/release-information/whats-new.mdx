### Monday, 25 May 2020

- Added [Time picker](https://www.figma.com/file/0bGXR2sCwMVSDNyyzu5BXrO5/UI%E2%80%94User-Interface?node-id=13870%3A28124) component.
- Added examples for Date picker at Examples Desktop [UI Components](https://www.figma.com/file/luNobpDIWTuQ9rhyovGLBI/Desktop?node-id=624%3A0)

### Tuesday, 7 April 2020

**New**

- Added `Selected/Hover` and `Error/Hover` to the [Chips](https://www.figma.com/file/0bGXR2sCwMVSDNyyzu5BXrO5/UI%E2%80%94User-Interface?node-id=1%3A6) component.
- Added `Text + remove` to the [Chips](https://www.figma.com/file/0bGXR2sCwMVSDNyyzu5BXrO5/UI%E2%80%94User-Interface?node-id=1%3A6) component.
- Added `Read only` states to the [Table](https://www.figma.com/file/0bGXR2sCwMVSDNyyzu5BXrO5/UI%E2%80%94User-Interface?node-id=1%3A25) component.

### Thursday, 5 March 2020

**Changed**

- Updated [Table Header text](https://www.figma.com/file/0bGXR2sCwMVSDNyyzu5BXrO5/UI%E2%80%94User-Interface?node-id=2450%3A1219) component to include unit, icon for sorting (users can drag & drop icons directly from assets), and applied _Auto Layout_. _Auto Layout_ is a feature in Figma that adjusts the component based on the length of what the user writes. In the _Table Header text_ this means that the `Label`, `Unit`, and `Icon` will resize and move as expected. The only adjustment the user has to do is adjust the width of the component.

- Added component to [Table Cell input](https://www.figma.com/file/0bGXR2sCwMVSDNyyzu5BXrO5/UI%E2%80%94User-Interface?node-id=2450%3A2487): Table/Cell input/Active resting.

- Updated all states for [Table Cell monospaced numeric](https://www.figma.com/file/0bGXR2sCwMVSDNyyzu5BXrO5/UI%E2%80%94User-Interface?node-id=2450%3A1603) to be right aligned instead of left aligned.

### Thursday, 27 February 2020

**New**

- As a result of numerous requests, we have added [Buttons toggle](https://www.figma.com/file/0bGXR2sCwMVSDNyyzu5BXrO5/UI%E2%80%94User-Interface?node-id=27%3A3) to Figma. EDS provides two versions, and you can choose to use either an icon and no text, or text and no icon. Read about how to use it [here](https://eds.equinor.com/components/buttons-toggle/).
- Added Ghost icon buttons for [Buttons Secondary](https://www.figma.com/file/0bGXR2sCwMVSDNyyzu5BXrO5/UI%E2%80%94User-Interface?node-id=142%3A0) and [Buttons Danger](https://www.figma.com/file/0bGXR2sCwMVSDNyyzu5BXrO5/UI%E2%80%94User-Interface?node-id=142%3A3883).
- Updated background colour in [Table Cell Active](https://www.figma.com/file/0bGXR2sCwMVSDNyyzu5BXrO5/UI%E2%80%94User-Interface?node-id=2450%3A1505) and [Table Cell Hover](https://www.figma.com/file/0bGXR2sCwMVSDNyyzu5BXrO5/UI%E2%80%94User-Interface?node-id=2450%3A1505) to be more aligned with active and hover states elsewhere in EDS components.
