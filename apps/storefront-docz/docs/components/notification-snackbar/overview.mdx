import { Snackbar, Button } from '@equinor/eds-core-react'

_Snackbars_ provide brief temporary non-interrupting notifications at the bottom of the screen.

<!--One to two sentences as an introduction to the component-->

## Guidelines

<!--List how to use it, sizes, widths, grid interactions, color allowances -->

Snackbars provide an update on a process that has or will be performed. Snackbars deliver low priority information---while _Banners_ deliver medium priority and _Dialogs_ deliver high priority information. Snackbars appear centered at the bottom of the screen and disappear without user interaction. On wider screens they are left-aligned. Snackbars appear on-screen between 5-10 seconds before dismissing themselves, so keep text short.

Snackbars can have one action. This action should not be "Close " or "Dismiss" since snackbars disappear automatically. Actions such as "Undo" or "Retry" are acceptable. Snackbars can wrap up to two lines of text on smaller screens.

**Don't**

<!--Bullet point list if needed -->

- Do not stack snackbars.
- Do not show more than one snackbar at a time.
- Do not add links to the text.
- Do not add more than one action.
- Do not add icons to snackbars.
- Do not hide core functionality or navigation in snackbar actions.
