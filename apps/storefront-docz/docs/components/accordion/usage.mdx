## Figma

### How to add

1. Locate the **Assets** tab in the **Layers Panel**.
2. There are two ways to locate the `Accordion` component needed:
   - Use the search bar to search for a component grouping name or variation name.
   - Scroll through the folders list and open the grouping needed.
3. Once the component is located, click and drag it into the frame/artboard.

### How to use

1. Place the `Accordion` on your frame/artboard.
2. Rename the _Header label_.
3. Locate the **Design** tab in the **Inspector Panel**.
4. Resize the accordion to the width needed.
5. Resize the accordion to the height needed:
   - If the accordion is collapsed, then the height is 48px.
   - If the accordion is expanded, then the minimum height is 96px.
6. Change the action icon:
   - Locate and select the `Icon > Nested icon > Placeholder Icon` or `Icon > Nested icon > chevron down` _layer_ in the **Layers Panel**.
   - Locate the **Design** tab in the **Inspector Panel**.
   - Under the **Instance** section, click the icon name to expand the menu.
   - Choose a new icon.
7. For expanded accordions, build your own components to swap with the nested `Placeholder` instance if needed.
8. Locate and toggle off the _layer_ `Hide if top row of panel` in the **Layers Panel** for the top row of the accordion grouping.
9. Select all the accordion layers and convert them to a frame/artboard by using the following shortcut:
   - Mac: `Command` + `Option` + `G`
   - PC: `Ctrl` + `ALT` + `G`
10. Make sure to name the new group.
11. Locate the **Design** tab in the **Inspector Panel**.
12. Under the **Constraints** section, set up constraints.
