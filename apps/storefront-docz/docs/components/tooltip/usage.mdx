## Figma

### How to add

1. Locate the **Assets** tab in the **Layers Panel**.
2. There are two ways to locate the `Tooltip` component needed.
   - Use the search bar to search for a component grouping name or variation name.
   - Scroll through the folders list and open the grouping needed.
3. Once the component needed is located, click and drag it into the frame/artboard.

### How to use

1. Select the `Tooltip` in the frame/artboard.
2. Locate and expand the highlighted _layer_ in the **Layers Panel**.
3. Toggle off the visibility of the `Caret` _layers_ that are not needed.
4. Edit the text. If the text wraps over one line, add 16px in height per line of text added to the whole component.
