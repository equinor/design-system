import { Divider } from '@equinor/eds-core-react'

## Figma

### How to add

1. Locate the **Assets** tab in the **Layers Panel**.
2. There are two ways to locate the `Divider` component needed:
   _ Use the search bar to search for a component grouping name or variation name.
   _ Scroll through the folders list and open the grouping.
3. Once the component needed is located, click and drag it into the frame/artboard.

### How to use

1. Select the `Divider` in the frame/artboard.
2. Resize to the width needed. Never add height to _dividers_, only resize them horizontally in width.

## API

<PropsTable props={Divider.__docgenInfo.props} />
