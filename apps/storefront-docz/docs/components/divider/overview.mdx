A divider is a thin line that separates content into clear groups.

<!--One to two sentences as an introduction to the component-->

## Guidelines

<!--List how to use it, sizes, widths, grid interactions, color allowances -->

Dividers are not meant to scream, they are subtle ways to group sections. Dividers can only be used in the colors `UI Background/Default`, `UI Background/Light` and `UI Background/Medium`. Dividers can be used full-width where allowed by parent container, or attached to a column's width.

**Don't**

<!--Bullet point list if needed -->

- Do not use colors that are not approved for dividers.
- Do not change the thickness of the divider.
- Do not change the style of the divider.

## Variations

<!--One ### heading per frame in Figma, explaining each component in that frame. One 'content' section per variation if needed -->

There are two divider variations available for use---`Divider/Small` and `Divider/Medium`. The divider line is the same in both of these, yet the spacing around the divider is different.
