## Figma

### How to add

1. Locate the **Assets** tab in the **Layers Panel**.
2. There are two ways to locate the `Navigation: Breadcrumbs` components needed:
   - Use the search bar to search for a component grouping name or variation name.
   - Scroll through the folders list and open the relevant grouping.
3. Once the component needed is located, click and drag it into the frame/artboard.

### How to use

1. Place the `Navigation: Breadcrumbs` needed on the frame/artboard.
2. Select a `Navigation: Breadcrumbs` in the frame/artboard.
3. Locate and expand the highlighted _layer_ in the **Layers Panel**.
4. Edit the text. If the text wraps over one line, resize the width of the `Navigation: Breadcrumbs` to avoid line breaks.
5. Never add height to `Navigation: Breadcrumbs`, only resize them horizontally in width.
6. Repeat steps 2-5 until each breadcrumb has the correct label.
7. Align all the `Navigation: Breadcrumbs`to be side-by-side, bottom aligned making sure each breadcrumb touches the next.
8. Select all the `Navigation: Breadcrumbs` _layers_ and _group_ them together, always naming the grouped layer.
