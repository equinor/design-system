_Selection controls_ allow users to select options, make decisions and set preferences.

<!--One to two sentences as an introduction to the component-->

## Guidelines

<!--List how to use it, sizes, widths, grid interactions, color allowances -->

Selection controls are to be visible and understandable at a quick glance. Selected options are more visible than unselected. Selection controls are always accompanied with a clear label. Make sure that the labels are surrounded with a `Clickbound` that activates the selection control as well as the control itself.

**Don't**

<!--Bullet point list if needed -->

- Do not mix different selection controls within a grouped list.
- Do not use a selection control without a label.
- Do not resize any of the selection controls.

## Variations

<!--One ### heading per frame in Figma, explaining each component in that frame. One 'content' section per variation if needed -->

### Switch

Switches allow users to toggle a single item between two possible states, taking immediate action. The most common states for a switch is "on/off". There are two variations of the switch provided: `Small switch` and `Switch`. The small switch is best for tight spaces and should be used with caution.

**Don't**

<!--Bullet point list if needed -->

- Do not nest switches, use checkboxes instead.

### Checkbox

Checkboxes allow users to select one or more items from a list. Checkboxes can be used to turn an option on or off. Generally, checkboxes are used with a confirmation action, however, they can also take immediate effect. The default state of a checkbox is having no option selected.

Checkboxes can be nested children.

- When a parent checkbox is selected, all following children are selected.
- When a parent checkbox is unselected, all following children are unselected.
- When a child is unselected while other children are selected, the parent checkbox becomes indeterminate.

#### Checkbox selected
