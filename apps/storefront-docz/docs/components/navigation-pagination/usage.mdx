## Figma

### How to add

1. Locate the **Assets** tab in the **Layers Panel**.
2. There are two ways to locate the `Navigation: Pagination` component needed:
   - Use the search bar to search for a component grouping name or variation name.
   - Scrol through the folders list and open the grouping.
3. Once the component needed is located, click and drag it into the frame/artboard.

### How to use

1. Select the `Pagination` in the frame/artboard.
2. Locate and expand the highlighted _layer_ in the **Layers Panel**.
3. If using `Total + page numbers` or the `Switcher + total + page numbers` edit the text.
4. Never add height to _pagination_, only resize horizontally in width.
