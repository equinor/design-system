import { List } from '@equinor/eds-core-react'

## Figma

### How to add

1. Select the text in the frame/artboard.
2. For bullet lists, manually add a `•`, `∙` or `◦` before each line.
   - Figma does not support indenting, so each indented level needs four `spaces` added before it.
3. For numbered lists, manually add the numbers `1.`, `2.` and so on before each line.
   - Figma does not support indenting, so each indented level needs four `spaces` added before it.

## API

### List

<PropsTable props={List.__docgenInfo.props} />

### ListItem

<PropsTable props={List.ListItem.__docgenInfo.props} />
