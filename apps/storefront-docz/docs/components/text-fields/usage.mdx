import { TextField } from '@equinor/eds-core-react'

## Figma

### How to add

1. Locate the **Assets** tab in the **Layers Panel**.
2. There are two ways to locate the `Text field` component needed:
   - Use the search bar to search for a component grouping name or variation name.
   - Scroll through the folders list and open the grouping.
3. Once the component needed is located, click and drag it into the frame/artboard.

### How to use

1. Select the `Text field` in the frame/artboard.
2. Locate and expand the highlighted _layer_ in the **Layers Panel**.
3. Toggle off the groupings that are not needed. All groupings besides `Unit` are on by defualt.
4. Never add height to _Text field/Inputs_, only resize them horizontally in width. _Text field/Area_ can be resized in both height and width.
5. In the **Layers panel** show the unit and/or placeholder icon as needed and adjust the unit text. Drag and drop an icon from the assets panel directly into the placeholder icon using:

- Mac: `Command` + `Option`
- PC: `Ctrl` + `ALT`
