import { Search } from '@equinor/eds-core-react'

_Search_ allows users to locate or refine content based on simple words or phrases.

<!--One to two sentences as an introduction to the component-->

## Guidelines

<!--List how to use it, sizes, widths, grid interactions, color allowances -->

Users can type a term and press `Enter` to see the results. Auto-complete, recent searches, suggested searches and pre/post-scoping are available via the _Menu_ component.

### Global Search

Global search can be used a a primary way of discovering content. The global search placeholder text should always say "Search". The global search should replace the _Center custom content, placeholder_ of the `Top bar`. The global search can be a button icon that is expanded into the `Search field` if search is less common in the application.

### In-context Search

In-context search allows users to search within a section of content---such as a table. The placeholder text should give users a hint at what type of results they can expect.

## Variations

<!--One ### heading per frame in Figma, explaining each component in that frame. One 'content' section per variation if needed -->

### Field

### Scope

Scoping allows users to narrow their search before they start. The _Scope_ can be changed by opening the menu. The default choice for the scope should always be "All".

      <div style={{ display: 'grid', gridGap: '1rem' }}>
        <Search aria-label="sitewide" id="search-normal" placeholder="Search" />
        <Search
          aria-label="predefined"
          id="search-predefined"
          placeholder="Search"
          defaultValue="Predefined value"
        />
