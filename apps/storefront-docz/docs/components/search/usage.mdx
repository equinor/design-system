import { Search } from '@equinor/eds-core-react'

## Figma

### How to add

1. Locate the **Assets** tab in the **Layers Panel**.
2. There are two ways to locate the `Search` components needed:
   - Use the search bar to search for a component grouping name or variation name.
   - Scroll through the folders list and open the relevant grouping.
3. Once the component needed is located, click and drag it into the frame/artboard.

### How to use

1. Place the `Search field` needed on the frame/artboard.
2. If needed, place the `Search Scope` on the frame/artboard.

- Make sure to leave **2px** between the _field_ and the _scope_.
- If using a `Menu` that supports typing, keep the _cursor_ layer visible, otherwise hide the layer.
- Hide the _hover hand_ or _hover cursor_ layer based on your needs.

3. Edit the text. Do not change the icons.
4. Never add height, only resize horizontally in width.
5. Select all the `Search` _layers_ and _group_ them together, always naming the grouped layer.
