## Figma

### How to add

1. Locate the **Assets** tab in the **Layers Panel**.
2. There are two ways to locate the `Card` component needed:
   - Use the search bar to search for a component grouping name or variation name.
   - Scroll through the folders list and open the grouping needed.
3. Once the component is located, click and drag it into the frame/artboard.
4. Cards are like Legos, add as many of the card components needed.

### How to use

1. Place the `card/container` as the bottom _layer_ of your _card_.
2. Toggle the grid layout on/off by using the following shortcut:
   - Mac: `Control` + `G`
   - PC: `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `4`
3. Align the _card_ to fit within the grid applied to your frame/artboard.
4. Stack additional _card_ components above the `card/container`, making sure to follow the grid within the `card/container`.
   - `Rich media/Leading image` is always full width and ignores the card's innner grid.
   - All `Title` and `Action` blocks are only to be resized in width, not height.
5. Select all the `Card` layers and convert them to a frame/artboard by using the following shortcut:
   - Mac: `Command` + `Option` + `G`
   - PC: `Ctrl` + `ALT` + `G`
6. Make sure to name the new group.
7. Locate the **Design** tab in the **Inspector Panel**.
8. Under the **Constraints** section, set up constraints.
