import { Card, Icon, Typography, Button, Avatar } from '@equinor/eds-core-react'
import { Playground } from 'docz'

A _card_ displays content related to a single subject and acts as an entry point to more detailed information. Card blocks can be combined in a variety of ways.

## Guidelines

Cards should display data related to a single topic. They are easy to scan and have clear actions. Cards can be customized by combining different _card_ blocks. Dividers can be used to separate sections within a card, however, the divider should not be full-width, except when displaying content that can be expanded.

**Don't**

- Do not use cards as or in _Top bars_
- Do not use cards as _Sidesheets_
- Do not use cards as or in _Nav drawers_
- Do not use cards as _Lists_
- Do not use cards inside other cards
- Do not use cards as galleries
- Do not use cards with text over photography or illustrations
- Do not use cards to group large sets of information

## Variations

### Card container

The `container` is the only required block in a card. The card aligns to the artboard/frames grid columns, which gives the card a fluid width. Content blocks within the card, however, follow the card container's own grid. There are four available `card/container` options: `default`, `info`, `danger` and `warning`. The primary action of a card is generally the card itself being a large touch target.

### Title

There are twelve title blocks to choose between: `Avatar H6 caption`, `Avatar H6 caption action`, `Overline H6`, `Overline H6 action`, `Overline H6 avatar`, `H4 body short`, `H4 body short action`, `H4 body short avatar`, `H5 body short`, `H5 body short action` and `H5 body short avatar`.

#### Content

Title blocks can have:

- Title
- Subtitle
- Avatar
- Metadata
  - Tags, badges and free text
- Overflow menu

/>

### Supporting text

There are two supporting text blocks to choose between: `supporting-text/middle` which is to be used when it is sandwiched between other blocks, and `supporting-text/last` which is to be used when it is the last block.

#### Content

Supporting text blocks can have:

- Supporting text
  - Should not contain multiple paragraphs
  - Use inline links with high caution

### Rich media

There are three rich media blocks to choose between: `rich-media/middle` which is to be used when it is sandwiched between other blocks, `rich-media/last` which is to be used when it is the last block and `rich-media/leading-image` which is to be used when it is the first block. The `rich-media/middle` and `rich-media/last` blocks are placeholder blocks, meaning that you can add your own rich content to them. Rich media can be used full-width, and if it's the first block on the card, it can go all the way to top

#### Content

Rich media blocks can have:

- Graph
- Table
- Image
  - within the grid when between blocks and full width when leading
- Dividers

/>

### Supplemental actions

There are three supplemental action blocks to choose between: `supplemental-actions/buttons`, `supplemental-actions/icons` and `supplemental-actions/meta`. Supplemental actions are represented by buttons, icons, UI controls and supporting text. A rule of thumb is to place them at the bottom of a card.

#### Content

Supplemental action blocks can have:

- Supplemental actions
- Dividers
  - Content that can be expanded should use full-width dividers, ignoring the horizontal spacing.
- Overflow menu
- UI controls
- Chips
