## Child components

The `<Accordion />` is a compound component, so in order to get to the child components you must either use destructuring or dot notation.

### Destructuring

```jsx
import { Accordion } from '@equinor/eds-core-react'

const {
  AccordionItem,
  AccordionHeader,
  AccordionHeaderTitle,
  AccordionPanel,
} = Accordion

<Accordion>
  <AccordionItem>
    <AccordionHeader>Header 1</AccordionHeader>
    <AccordionPanel>Content 1</AccordionPanel>
  </AccordionItem>
</Accordion>
```

### Dot notation

```jsx
import { Accordion } from '@equinor/eds-core-react'
<Accordion>
  <Accordion.AccordionItem>
    <Accordion.AccordionHeader>Header 1</Accordion.AccordionHeader>
    <Accordion.AccordionPanel>Content 1</Accordion.AccordionPanel>
  </Accordion.AccordionItem>
</Accordion>
```

In a simple Accordion where you only have a text-string in the header, you can ommit the `<AccordionHeaderTitle />` from `<AccordionHeader />` and it will be inserted for you. In more complex use cases however, where you have both text and components in the header, or where the title itself contains a component, you must wrap the title in `<AccordionHeaderTitle />`.

```jsx
<Accordion>
  <AccordionItem>
    <AccordionHeader>
      <AccordionHeaderTitle>
        Header <em>1</em>
      </AccordionHeaderTitle>
      <Icon
        name="attach_file"
        title="Attach file"
        size={16}
        color="currentColor"
        style={{ marginRight: '32px' }}
      />
      <Icon
        name="notifications"
        title="Notifications"
        size={16}
        color="currentColor"
      />
    </AccordionHeader>
  </AccordionItem>
</Accordion>
```

## Props

Both the `<Accordion />` and `<Accordion.AccordionItem />` components take props.

### Accordion

<ArgsTable of={Accordion} />

### AccordionItem

<ArgsTable of={Accordion.AccordionItem} />

## Examples of props and custom header content
