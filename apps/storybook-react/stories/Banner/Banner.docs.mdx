_Banners_ display important notifications and related optional actions.

<!--One to two sentences as an introduction to the component-->

## Guidelines

<!--List how to use it, sizes, widths, grid interactions, color allowances -->

Notification banners should communicate a change or error. Banners are always at the top of the page but below the _Top bar_. Banners require an action in order to be dismissed. Banners deliver medium priority information---while _Snackbars_ deliver low priority and _Dialogs_ delivery high priority information. Banners are meant to be slightly interruptive but not overly distracting. Banners can be fixed or scroll away with content.

Banners are also known as _Top bar_ or _Alerts_.

**Don't**

<!--Bullet point list if needed -->

- Do not put a banner above the top bar.
- Do not use more than one banner at a time.
- Do not include links in the text.
